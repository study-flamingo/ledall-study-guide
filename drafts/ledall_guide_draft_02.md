## ABOUT THIS MANUSCRIPT

The Ledall Roll stands as the **most technically comprehensive of only three surviving Medieval English martial arts manuscripts**. Dating to approximately 1535-1550, this scroll-format manual (vellum roll measuring 152.5mm × 622mm) contains 38-41 plays documenting a distinctive Tudor-era fighting system emphasizing displacement, one-handed techniques, and structured training sequences.

### Historical Significance

As Mark Ryan Geldof notes in his 2023 academic article, the manuscript likely represents "a corrupted copy where the roll was copied by rote from an older document by a scribe who didn't understand the material well enough to recognize that the pages were out of order."[1] The attribution "Amen Quod J Ledall" appears awkwardly between lessons rather than as a closing signature, suggesting scribal attribution to John Ledall of York (c. 1515-1582), a wealthy merchant who became Chamberlain of York in 1547.

### What Makes English Longsword Different

Robert Kay, approaching from German longsword training, identifies the core distinction: "There is no mention of feeling in the techniques or chases. Further, the quick displacing cuts seem to be how the English system controls the centerline. **Very little winding, lots of displacement and thrusting.**"[2]

Where German *Liechtenauer* tradition emphasizes *fühlen* (feeling) in the bind and extended blade contact through winding (*winden*), the English system prioritizes **immediate displacement followed by thrust**. Binding appears transitional rather than strategic—a momentary contact leading to immediate riposte rather than an extended conversation of the blades.[3]

### Key Terminology

**GUARDS (WARDS)**
- **Roebuck** = German *Ochs* (point-forward at head height)
- **Hawk** = German *Vom Tag* (raised position ready to throw cuts)
- **Stop Guard** = German *Pflug* (hands near waist, point threatening)
- **Boar** = German *Alber* (sword low, point down)
- **Dragon's Tail** = Italian *Posta de coda lunga*

**OFFENSIVE ACTIONS**
- **Quarter Stroke** = Diagonal downward cuts (*Oberhau*/*Fendente*)
- **Contrary Hawk** = Rising cuts (*Unterhau*/*Sottone*)
- **Foin** (foyne) = Any thrust
- **Broken Foin** = Thrust while maintaining blade contact (*Absetzen*)
- **Rabett** = Countercuts against opponent's weapon
- **Spring** = One-handed extension gripping near pommel for maximum reach
- **Rake** = Quick wrist cuts targeting hands/arms (*Stromazzone*)

## PART I: FLOURISHES

The Flourishes represent **solo training forms** similar to Asian kata—structured sequences allowing practice without partners. The Academy of Historical Arts describes them as patterns that "warm up the body, build muscle memory, and teach the fundamental flow between techniques."[4]

### CHAPTER 1: THE FIRST FLOURISH

**Original Text:** *The ſirte fflorysh A quartr fayre be fore you deliueryde wt an hande voydyng bake the ryght fote. Wyth an other quartr wt bothe hands. A Downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake the lyfte fote standyng ſtyll play iij Rakys lythly Clevyng by thelbowes wt a quartr fayre be fore yow wyth both handys And ij qurters after wt ij turnes A downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake the lyfte fote Styll ſtanding play ye fayde iij Rakes wt a quartr farye be fore yow And ij quarters after wt ij turnes. A downe ryght ſtroke ſettyng forth ye ryght fote as fore as ye lyffte wt a brokon foyne uppon the lyffte ſyde an other on ye ryght ſyde turnyng ye ſwerde undr ye ryght arme bryng hyt wt ye ſame ſyde wyth a brokyn foyne uppon ye leffte ſyde an other uppon the ryght ſyde turnyng yor ſwerde ſete the poynt ſoffte be fore yow uppon the grownde.*

**Modern English:** A Quarter fair before you, delivered with one hand. Voiding back the right foot with another Quarter with both hands. A Downright stroke voiding back the left foot, standing still play 3 Rakes lightly cutting to the elbows, with a Quarter fair before you with both hands. And 2 Quarters after with 2 turns, a Downright-stroke voiding back the left foot. Standing still play the said 3 Rakes with a Quarter fair before you and 2 Quarters after with 2 turns. A Downright-stroke setting forth the right foot as forward as your left with a broken thrust upon the left side, another on the right side turning the sword under the right arm. Bring it with the same side with a broken thrust upon the left side, another upon the right side, turning your sword set the point soft before you upon the ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Flourishes are fundamental warm-up patterns. Focus on smooth transitions between one and two-handed grips—this is a distinctive feature of the English system."[4]

> "Rakes should be 'lightly cleaving by the elbows'—these are quick, weak wrist cuts targeting the opponent's forearms and hands, not power cuts. Think of them as harassment strikes."[3]

**Key Points:**
- Begin with one-handed Quarter to practice spring technique
- Void steps combine offense with retreat—"attacking while retreating"[3]
- Broken thrusts are partial/feinted thrusts that maintain blade contact
- The pattern trains muscle memory for transitioning between grips
- Set the point "soft" on ground—controlled, not dropped

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Quarter (one-handed) | Stand | Practice one-handed control; grip near pommel for spring |
| 2 | Quarter (two-handed) | Void back right foot | Transition to two hands while retreating |
| 3 | Downright stroke | Void back left foot | Vertical descending cut |
| 4 | 3× Rakes to elbows | Stand still | Light, quick wrist cuts; harassment strikes |
| 5 | Quarter (two-handed) | Stand | "Fair before you"—delivered forward |
| 6-7 | 2× Quarters with turns | 2 body turns | 90° or 180° turns; maintain control |
| 8 | Downright stroke | Void back left foot | Repeat pattern element |
| 9 | 3× Rakes | Stand still | Second repetition of rakes |
| 10 | Quarter | Stand | Forward delivery |
| 11-12 | 2× Quarters with turns | 2 body turns | Complete the turning sequence |
| 13 | Downright stroke | Step right forward to even | Advance into measure |
| 14 | Broken thrust (left) | Stand | Partial thrust, maintain blade contact |
| 15 | Broken thrust (right) | Turn sword under right arm | Sword circles under arm |
| 16 | Bring sword to same side | Recover position | Preparatory position |
| 17 | Broken thrust (left) | Stand | Second sequence begins |
| 18 | Broken thrust (right) | Turn sword | Mirror previous action |
| 19 | Set point on ground | Stand | Controlled finish, "soft" placement |

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1-2:** Practice steps 1-7 slowly, focusing on smooth grip transitions  
**Week 3-4:** Add steps 8-12, maintaining rhythm through repetitions  
**Week 5-6:** Complete sequence with broken thrusts (steps 13-19)  
**Week 7+:** Increase speed while maintaining form; use as daily warm-up

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Dropping sword to ground rather than setting it softly
- Power-cutting the rakes instead of light harassment strikes  
- Losing balance during turns—keep center of gravity low
- Gripping too tightly—tension in one-handed sections reduces control
- Rushing through void steps—these teach the timing of retreat-while-attacking

### CHAPTER 2: THE SECOND FLOURISH

**Original Text:** *The Seconde fflorysh A quartr fayre be fore yow wyth won hand Standyng Å¿tyll Å¿ett In the ryght legge wt a Dragonestalle. then Å¿ete the lyffte hand uppon the Å¿worde Å¿mytyng a qurter fayre be fore yow wyth won hande turnyng yor boddy Å¿ete In yor ryght legge as forwarde as yor lyffte bryng the poynte of the Å¿word ov yor hede Å¿ete hyt down Å¿offtely be fore yow uppon the growne Then Å¿tandyng Å¿tyll pley yor Rakys uppon what Å¿yde you wyll rystyng uppon ye ryght arme then Å¿myte a Downeryght Å¿troke voydyng bake ye lyffte legge bryng after ye ryght legge wt a rake lyfte up ye Å¿werde ov yor hede bryng forwarde the ryght legge as forewarde as ye lyffte pley a brokyn foyne uppon what Å¿yde that you wyll turnyng ye Å¿worde ov the ryght arme Å¿ettyng ye poynte Å¿offtely be fore yow on the grownde*

**Modern English:** A Quarter fair before you with one hand standing still. Set in the right leg with a Dragon's Tayle, then set the left hand upon the sword, smiting a Quarter fair before you. With one hand, turning your body, set in your right leg as forward as your left, bringing the point of the sword over your head, set it down softly before you upon the ground. Then, standing still, play your Rakes upon any side, as often as you will, resting upon your right arm then smite a Downright-stroke voiding back the left leg, bringing after the right leg with a Rake. Lift up the sword, over your head, bringing forward the right leg as forward as the left, play a Broken thrust upon any side. Turning the sword over the right arm, setting the point softly before you on the ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Dragon's Tail position (Posta de coda lunga) is a low guard with sword point behind and down. The set-in movement brings the rear leg forward into this position—it's a preparatory stance that loads power for the following quarter cut."[3]

> "Notice 'play your Rakes upon any side, as often as you will, resting upon your right arm'—this gives the practitioner freedom to drill rakes on either side, building ambidextrous control. The 'resting upon right arm' suggests a guard position supporting the weight."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Dragon's Tail features prominently—practice low guard transitions
- "Turning your body" with the quarter emphasizes hip rotation for power
- Freedom to practice rakes on either side builds bilateral skill
- Second flourish is more advanced than first—assume First is mastered

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Quarter (one-handed) | Stand still | "Fair before you"—forward delivery |
| 2 | Dragon's Tail | Set in right leg | Rear leg advances; low guard, point behind |
| 3 | Set left hand on sword | Stand | Transition to two-handed grip |
| 4 | Quarter | Turn body | Hip rotation generates power |
| 5 | One-handed quarter | Step right forward to even | Release to one hand while advancing |
| 6 | Bring point over head | Stand | Sword arc overhead |
| 7 | Set point on ground | Stand | Controlled, soft placement |
| 8 | Rakes (any side, any number) | Stand, rest on right arm | Free practice; supported guard position |
| 9 | Downright stroke | Void back left leg | Standard retreat-attack |
| 10 | Rake | Bring back right leg | Follow retreat with rake |
| 11 | Lift sword overhead | Stand | Preparatory position |
| 12 | Broken thrust (any side) | Step right forward to even | Practitioner chooses side |
| 13 | Turn sword over right arm | Stand | Circular recovery motion |
| 14 | Set point on ground | Stand | Soft, controlled finish |

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1:** Steps 1-7 (Dragon's Tail entry and first sequence)  
**Week 2:** Steps 8-10 (Free rake practice—start with 3-5 rakes per side)  
**Week 3:** Steps 11-14 (Broken thrust sequence)  
**Week 4+:** Full integration; increase rake repetitions; vary chosen sides

#### DRAGON'S TAIL GUARD DETAIL

The Dragon's Tail (*Dragonestalle*) is explicitly named in this flourish. Based on comparative analysis with Italian sources:

- **Sword Position:** Point behind body, angled down toward ground  
- **Hand Position:** Hands low, approximately hip level or below  
- **Body Position:** Weight on rear leg; coiled, ready to spring forward  
- **Tactical Purpose:** Deceptive guard inviting high attacks; loads power for rising cuts or sudden advances

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Rushing into Dragon's Tail without proper weight transfer
- Gripping too far from pommel on one-handed sections—limits reach
- Mechanical rakes without targeting intention—visualize elbow/forearm targets
- Dropping sword point instead of controlled overhead arc
- Inconsistent turning direction—establish pattern and maintain it

### CHAPTER 3: THE LAYING DOWN OF THE SWORD

**Original Text:** *The leyyng downe of the Swerde A quartr delvyde fayre be fore you then fayre tur about on yor lyffte Syde Set yn yor ryght legge bryngyng yor Sword over yor hede Sette yt Sofftly downe befure yow on the grounde*

**Modern English:** A Quarter delivered fair before you, then fair turn about on your left side. Set in your right leg, bringing your sword over your head. Set it softly down before you on the ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "This is the formal conclusion to training—the ceremonial setting down of the weapon. The phrase 'softly down' appears repeatedly in English sources, emphasizing control and respect for the weapon."[4]

**Key Points:**
- Formal closing ceremony, not a combat technique  
- "Turn about on your left side" = 180° or 360° turn using left as pivot  
- Control to the very end—tests balance and blade awareness  
- Can be used to end any training session, not just flourishes

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Quarter | Stand | Final cut delivered forward |
| 2 | Turn on left side | Pivot 180°-360° left | "Fair turn"—smooth, controlled |
| 3 | Set in right leg | Step right forward | Advance into final position |
| 4 | Bring sword over head | Stand | Arc overhead |
| 5 | Set point on ground | Stand | Soft, controlled, ceremonial |

#### CEREMONIAL SIGNIFICANCE

Medieval martial training included formal openings and closings. This brief ceremony:
- Marks the transition from training to rest
- Demonstrates control—setting down rather than dropping
- Shows respect for the weapon and art
- Provides mental closure to the session

The Academy of Historical Arts notes: "Ending forms properly was as important as beginning them correctly. The 'laying down' marks the boundary between the martial mindset and everyday consciousness."[4]

#### TRAINING USE

**As Session Closer:**
- Complete any flourish or chase sequence
- Execute "Laying Down of the Sword"
- Take moment of stillness before picking up weapon
- Signals mental transition out of combat awareness

**As Meditation:**
- Can be performed slowly as moving meditation
- Focus on perfect control throughout
- Breath synchronized with movements
- Mindful placement of sword on ground

## PART II: THE CHASES

The thirteen Chases form the **technical core** of the English longsword system. As Brandon Heslop notes, these are "structured sequences—possibly designed as partner drills or solo forms—that progressively teach combinations."[3] 

Unlike the Flourishes (solo warm-ups) or the Counters (defensive responses), the Chases appear to be **choreographed training sequences** that could be practiced alone or with a partner. Many modern practitioners interpret them as two-person drills where both fencers perform the same sequence in turn.

### Chase Structure & Purpose

Each Chase typically:
1. Begins from a specific guard or stance
2. Progresses through a combination of cuts, thrusts, and footwork
3. Ends with a "return to ground" notation indicating the sequence can repeat

The phrase "and if it be twice played it will bring you to your ground" appears frequently, suggesting these are **traveling patterns**—sequences that move you through space but return you to starting position when repeated.[6]

---

### CHAPTER 4: THE FIRST CHASE

**Original Text:** *The Fyrste Chace he that firſte Smytes wyth a hauke or a quarter ov he Swerd Smyte ov yor Swerde to the grounde and foyne att ye ov op'yng and yf he Sett that Smyte upon the Swerd as ſoone as ye Swerd tu Smyte of the tother Syde and after yt by all one*

**Modern English:** He that first smites with a Hawk or a Quarter, over his sword smite over your sword to the ground and foin at the upper opening. And if he set that, smite upon the sword as soon as the sword touch, smite of the other side and after it by all one.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The First Chase mirrors the German Zornhau Ort: when the opponent strikes with a hawk or quarter cut, cut over their sword to deflect it groundward, then foin to the upper opening."[3]

> "This establishes the system's fundamental pattern of **displacement followed by counter-thrust**. The English don't try to win the bind—they displace quickly and thrust into the opening."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Core defensive pattern: displace downward → thrust high
- "If he set that" = if opponent blocks your thrust
- "Upon the sword as soon as touch" = immediately upon blade contact
- "Smite of the other side" = cut to opposite opening
- This is the foundational Chase—master it before progressing

**Tactical Application:**
The First Chase addresses the most common attack (descending cut) with the most efficient defense (displacement cut + thrust). By deflecting the opponent's sword groundward, you:
1. Clear the centerline
2. Create an upper opening
3. Maintain forward pressure with the thrust
4. Have backup plan if thrust is blocked (cut to other side)

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **OPPONENT** | Hawk or Quarter cut | Advances | Initial attack—high descending cut |
| 1 | Displace opponent's sword down | Stand or pass | Cut over their sword, drive it to ground |
| 2 | Foin to upper opening | Maintain/extend | Thrust to head, neck, or upper chest |
| **IF BLOCKED** | | | Alternative sequence if thrust is set |
| 3 | Strike on sword (percussion) | Stand | Hit their blade as contact is made |
| 4 | Cut to other side | Maintain | Immediately redirect to opposite opening |
| 5 | Continue pattern | Stand | "After it by all one"—repeat as needed |

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Solo Practice:**
1. Visualize opponent's descending cut
2. Practice displacement cut at 45° angle downward
3. Immediate transition to thrust
4. If blade still present, practice percussion strike + redirect

**Partner Drill (Feeder Pattern):**
- **Partner A (Feeder):** Delivers slow Hawk or Quarter
- **Partner B (Responder):** Executes Chase sequence
- Partner A gradually increases speed as B improves
- Switch roles after 10 repetitions

**Pressure Testing:**
- Partner A resists displacement—doesn't let sword go down easily
- Partner B must commit full power to displacement
- Add blocking of thrust to trigger percussion/redirect sequence
- Free flow: A can deliver Hawk or Quarter at will; B must respond

#### COMPARATIVE TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS

**German *Zornhau Ort* (Wrath Cut Point):**
- Similar displacement of incoming cut
- German version emphasizes winding in the bind
- English version emphasizes immediate thrust without winding

**Italian *Fendente con Punta* (Descending Cut with Point):**
- Italian version may parry then thrust
- English displaces AND thrusts in one motion
- Faster execution, less time in blade contact

**Key Difference:** The English system avoids extended blade contact. The displacement is meant to **remove the threat** rather than engage in binding, immediately followed by offense.[5]

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak displacement that doesn't fully clear opponent's blade
- Pausing between displacement and thrust—must be one fluid motion
- Thrusting off-line instead of into genuine opening
- Forgetting the "if he set that" contingency—always have plan B
- Over-committing to thrust without maintaining balance for recovery

#### TACTICAL NOTES

**When to Use:**
- Against any high descending attack
- Opponent favors Hawk or Quarter cuts
- You need simple, reliable defense under pressure
- As opening gambit to test opponent's defenses

**Counters to Watch For:**
- Opponent feints high, cuts low
- Opponent aborts cut mid-stroke (void or gather)
- Opponent strikes with wrist rather than full cut (your displacement misses)
- Opponent's cut is actually a thrust in disguise

### CHAPTER 5: THE SECOND CHASE

**Original Text:** *The Seconde Chace A dowble rownde wyth a bake foyne and a quartr lyghtly delyvyde And hyt be tweys playde hyt wyll bryng you a gayne to yor ground.*

**Modern English:** A Double Round, with a Back-thrust, and a Quarter lightly delivered. And it be twice played it will bring you again to your ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Second Chase is a traveling pattern—a sequence that moves you through space. 'Double round' likely refers to circular footwork or blade work, possibly full 360° rotations."[6]

**Key Points:**
- This is a **movement drill**, not a combat application  
- "Double round" = two circular motions (footwork, blade, or both)
- "Back-thrust" = thrust while moving backward, or reverse-grip thrust
- "Twice played" returns you to start = 720° total rotation
- "Lightly delivered" = quick, not powerful

**Interpretation Challenges:**
The manuscript doesn't specify whether "round" means:
- Circular footwork (turning/pivoting)
- Circular blade work (moulinets/cuts)
- Full body rotation (spinning)

Modern reconstructions explore all possibilities. Most practitioners interpret it as **circular footwork with blade describing circles** overhead or at sides.

#### STEP BREAKDOWN (CIRCULAR FOOTWORK INTERPRETATION)

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | First Round | 360° rotation (CW or CCW) | Sword describes circle overhead/side |
| 2 | Second Round | 360° rotation (same direction) | Complete second full rotation |
| 3 | Back-thrust | Step backward | Thrust while retreating |
| 4 | Quarter | Stand | "Lightly delivered"—quick cut |
| 5-8 | Repeat sequence | Return rotation | Second playthrough returns to start |

#### ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATION (BLADE MOLINETS)

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1-2 | Double Round (molinets) | Stand or slow advance | Two circular blade motions (like figure-8) |
| 3 | Back-thrust | Step backward | Thrust from moulinet momentum |
| 4 | Quarter | Stand or continue retreat | Transition cut |
| 5-8 | Repeat | Return path | Mirror sequence back to start |

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Stationary Practice**
- Practice two full 360° rotations with sword overhead
- Keep sword moving in smooth circles
- Add back-thrust from final rotation position
- Finish with light quarter cut

**Week 2: Add Footwork**
- Slow walk forward while executing rotations
- Time rotations to footwork rhythm
- Back-thrust with deliberate backward step
- Quarter while recovering balance

**Week 3: Spatial Awareness**
- Note starting position on floor
- Execute sequence twice
- Should return to within 1-2 feet of start
- Adjust rotations/steps to improve accuracy

**Week 4+: Speed and Flow**
- Increase rotation speed while maintaining control
- Smooth transitions between all elements
- Practice both clockwise and counter-clockwise
- Use as conditioning drill

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

While primarily a movement drill, the Second Chase teaches:

**Spatial Management:**
- Maintaining orientation during rotations
- Returning to position after complex movements
- Not getting "lost" in the fight

**Momentum Control:**
- Circular blade movements build momentum
- Back-thrust uses rotational energy
- Quarter cut resets to neutral

**Intimidation/Confusion:**
- Spinning movements can disorient opponents
- Creates uncertainty about attack direction
- Demonstrates control and confidence

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Getting dizzy from rotations—keep eyes on horizon, not ground
- Losing sword control during spins—maintain firm grip
- Back-thrust too weak—use rotation momentum
- Quarter cut too heavy—"lightly delivered" means quick snap
- Uneven rotations—second round should match first

### CHAPTER 6: THE THIRD CHASE

**Original Text:** *The thyrde Chace A dowble rownde forwarde an other bakwarde A downe ryght stroke voydyng bake ye lyffte legge a bake foyne voydyng bake the ryght legge folowyng In wyth the lyffte legge ſmyte a quartr bakewarde And yff hyt be tweys plade gyt wyll bryng you to yor grounde*

**Modern English:** A Double Round forward, another backward. A Down-right stroke voiding back the left leg, a Back-thrust voiding back the right leg, following in with the left leg smite a Quarter backward. And if it be twice played it will bring you to your ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Third Chase introduces advance-retreat rhythm—moving forward with rounds, then retreating while maintaining offensive pressure. This is the English emphasis on 'attacking while retreating' in practice."[3]

> "Notice the footwork pattern: void back left, void back right, step forward left, quarter backward. This creates a rocking motion that manages distance while keeping the opponent under pressure."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Forward and backward "rounds" establish directional movement
- Consecutive voids (left, then right) create significant distance
- "Following in with left leg" disrupts retreat pattern—sudden advance
- "Quarter backward" = cut delivered while moving away
- Complex pattern teaches distance management

**Tactical Applications:**
- Draw opponent forward with retreat
- Sudden advance (step in with left) surprises opponent
- Quarter backward maintains threat during final retreat
- Teaches not to flee mindlessly—control the distance

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Double Round | Forward movement | Two circular motions while advancing |
| 2 | Double Round | Backward movement | Two circular motions while retreating |
| 3 | Downright stroke | Void back left leg | Vertical cut while stepping back (left) |
| 4 | Back-thrust | Void back right leg | Thrust while continuing retreat (right) |
| 5 | (Movement only) | Step forward with left | Sudden advance disrupts pattern |
| 6 | Quarter backward | Continuing retreat | Cut delivered while moving away |
| 7-12 | Repeat full sequence | Return to start | "Twice played" returns to ground |

#### DISTANCE MANAGEMENT BREAKDOWN

**Phase 1 (Steps 1-2): Establishing Range**
- Forward rounds: Close to contact distance
- Backward rounds: Open distance, create space
- Net movement: Near original position

**Phase 2 (Steps 3-4): Aggressive Retreat**
- Downright + void left: Attack while retreating
- Back-thrust + void right: Continue pressure while opening distance
- Net movement: 4-6 feet backward from opponent

**Phase 3 (Steps 5-6): Distance Disruption**
- Step forward (left): Sudden closing—opponent expects continued retreat
- Quarter backward: Immediate return to retreat with attack
- Net movement: Opponent confused about your distance intentions

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Footwork Only**
- Practice the stepping pattern without sword
- Forward rounds = advance 4-6 steps
- Backward rounds = retreat 4-6 steps
- Void left, void right, step forward left, continue back
- Should return to start when repeated

**Week 2: Add Sword Work (Slow)**
- Add circular blade motions to rounds
- Downright stroke coordinated with left void
- Back-thrust coordinated with right void
- Quarter cut as you move backward

**Week 3: Increase Speed**
- Smooth transitions between all elements
- No pause between downright and back-thrust
- Sudden acceleration on forward step (element 5)
- Control on final backward quarter

**Week 4+: Partner Awareness**
- Practice with partner maintaining distance
- Partner advances when you retreat
- Partner retreats when you advance
- Your sudden forward step (5) should surprise partner

#### TACTICAL PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED

**1. Retreat ≠ Defeat:**
The English system teaches that retreating while attacking maintains the initiative. Your opponent must respect your blade even as you create distance.

**2. Rhythm Disruption:**
Establishing a pattern (retreat, retreat) then breaking it (sudden advance) creates openings. Opponents anticipate continuation of established rhythms.

**3. Distance Control:**
You dictate the engagement distance. The opponent must react to your movements rather than imposing their preferred range.

**4. Continuous Threat:**
Every movement includes an offensive action. There's no "pure defense"—even retreat carries threat (downright, back-thrust, quarter).

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Mechanical execution without distance awareness
- Weak downright stroke—it must threaten even while retreating
- Telegraphing the forward step—should be sudden
- Quarter backward off-balance—maintain posture during retreat
- Not returning to start position—indicates footwork errors

#### GEORGE SILVER CONNECTION

This Chase embodies Silver's later principles:

> "The best fight is the shortest fight. Make your space true and move not your feet until you see advantage."

The Third Chase teaches "making your space true"—controlling the distance through deliberate advance and retreat, attacking when you retreat, retreating when you attack, keeping the opponent uncertain about your intentions.[7]

### CHAPTER 7: THE FOURTH CHASE - "THE BOW-THRUST"

**Original Text:** *The fourthe Chace callyd ye bowne foyne A dowble rownde forwarde an other bakewarde a downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake the lyffte legge A bake foyne wt a bowfoyne voydyng bake wt the ryght legge lythtly ſmyte a quarter.*

**Modern English:** A Double Round forward an other backward. A Downright stroke voiding back the left leg, a Back-thrust, with a Bow-thrust voiding back with the right leg, lithely smite a Quarter.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fourth Chase introduces half-sword technique with the 'Bow-thrust.' While the exact meaning is debated, most practitioners interpret this as a thrust with shortened grip (one or both hands closer to the blade) for close-range effectiveness."[3]

**Key Points:**
- Builds on Third Chase pattern (double rounds, downright + void)
- "Bow-thrust" is unique technique requiring interpretation
- "Lithely" = lightly, quickly, with agility  
- Combination of back-thrust AND bow-thrust suggests two distinct actions
- Pattern similar to Third Chase but adds specialized technique

**Bow-Thrust Interpretations:**

**Theory 1: Half-Sword Thrust**
- Grip shortened by moving front hand onto blade
- "Bow" refers to arching shape of arms
- Used in close quarters or against armor
- Similar to German *Halbschwert*

**Theory 2: Arcing Thrust**
- Thrust that curves around opponent's defense
- "Bow" describes arc trajectory
- Delivered from rotation of hips/shoulders
- Enters around guard rather than straight through

**Theory 3: Two-Stage Thrust**
- Back-thrust sets up position
- Bow-thrust is follow-up with different angle
- "With a bow-thrust" = accompanied by
- Both thrusts delivered in quick succession

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Double Round | Forward | Two circular motions advancing |
| 2 | Double Round | Backward | Two circular motions retreating |
| 3 | Downright stroke | Void back left leg | Attack while retreating |
| 4 | Back-thrust | Stand | Thrust from downright position |
| 5 | Bow-thrust | Void back right leg | Specialized thrust technique |
| 6 | Quarter | Stand | "Lithely"—quick, light cut |

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Review Third Chase**
- Ensure solid foundation before adding bow-thrust
- Focus on downright + void left sequence
- Practice back-thrust from various positions

**Week 2: Bow-Thrust Experimentation**
- Try half-sword grip: hand on blade
- Try arcing thrust: curve around imagined defense
- Try two-thrust combination: back → bow
- Determine which interpretation feels most effective

**Week 3: Integration**
- Add chosen bow-thrust interpretation to full sequence
- Coordinate bow-thrust with right leg void
- Ensure litheness (speed and agility) on final quarter

**Week 4+: Refinement**
- Smooth transitions between all elements
- Test with partner: does bow-thrust get through defenses?
- Experiment with different interpretations in sparring
- Document which interpretation works best for your body type

#### HALF-SWORD TECHNIQUE DETAIL

If interpreting as half-sword thrust:

**Grip Transition:**
1. From downright stroke, blade is extended
2. During back-thrust, front hand slides toward crossguard
3. For bow-thrust, front hand grips blade itself
4. Thumb on flat of blade, fingers wrapped around
5. Both hands drive thrust with shortened lever

**Advantages:**
- Greater control in close distance
- More power in thrust (both hands driving)
- Can thrust through gaps in armor
- Difficult to displace with shortened grip

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires very close distance
- Hand on blade can be struck
- Reduces reach significantly
- Transition time from full grip

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use Fourth Chase:**
- Opponent forces close distance
- Need to practice half-sword transitions
- Opponent uses wide guards (bow-thrust arcs around)
- Want to pressure opponent with continuous retreat-attack

**Setup Opportunities:**
- After successful Third Chase that brings you close
- Opponent pursuing your retreat aggressively
- In armor (half-sword interpretation)
- When opponent expects standard thrust (bow-thrust surprises)

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Rushing bow-thrust without understanding technique
- Not voiding far enough on right leg—reduces safety
- Heavy quarter cut instead of "lithely" delivered
- Forgetting this builds on Third Chase—pattern should be familiar
- Not experimenting with different bow-thrust interpretations

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT

The term "bow" in medieval English could refer to:
- **Weapon (longbow/crossbow):** Unlikely in sword context
- **Bending/arcing:** "Bow" as verb, suggesting curved motion
- **Half-sword grip:** Arms form bow shape
- **Drawing back:** "Bow" related to drawing/pulling

Brandon Heslop notes: "We may never know the exact original meaning, but functional interpretation—what works in practice—guides modern reconstruction. Try multiple interpretations and use what proves effective."[3]

### CHAPTER 8: THE EIGHTH CHASE - "THE SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The Viijth Chace callyde the fypryng a quartr upon a man that Comes faft forwarde to yow then paffe forewarde wyth yor lyffte legge fmyte a nother quartr paffe wyth yor ryght legge fpryng att hys knee then voyde bake wyth the fame fote Smyte a quartr and be att your ſtope.*

**Modern English:** A Quarter upon a man that comes fast forward to you, then pass forward with your left leg, smite another Quarter. Pass with your right leg, spring at his knee, then void back with the same foot, smite a Quarter and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Eighth Chase directly addresses aggressive opponents. The signature **spring**—gripping near the pommel for maximum one-handed reach—is the defining English technique rarely emphasized in continental sources."[3]

> "The spring to the knee is a practical application paralleling the German *das Gayszlen* (goat strike). Targeting the knee disrupts the opponent's base and can end the fight immediately."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Defensive response to aggressive opponent
- Two quarters while advancing (pass left, pass right)
- **Spring** = one-handed extension, grip near pommel
- Target is knee—low-line attack opponent may not expect
- Void back maintains safety after spring
- "Be at your stop" = return to guard position

**The Spring Technique:**

The Spring is the most characteristic English longsword technique. Execution:

1. **Grip Adjustment:** Slide rear hand down haft toward pommel
2. **Weight Transfer:** Lean forward, extending sword
3. **One-Handed Extension:** Maximum reach (12-18" beyond normal)
4. **Target Selection:** Usually thrust, occasionally cut
5. **Recovery:** Immediate void or return to two hands

**Why It Works:**
- Unexpected reach surprises opponents
- One-handed control allows greater extension
- Low-line targeting (knee) avoids opponent's defense
- Creates distance advantage even if strike doesn't land

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **OPPONENT** | Aggressive advance | Moving toward you | Trigger: "man that comes fast forward" |
| 1 | Quarter | Stand or slight void | Meet aggression with cut |
| 2 | Quarter | Pass forward left leg | Advance into opponent's space |
| 3 | Quarter | Pass forward right leg | Continue advancing—aggressive response |
| 4 | Spring to knee | Stand (extended) | One-handed reach to low-line target |
| 5 | Void back | Same foot (right) | Immediate retreat for safety |
| 6 | Quarter | Stand | Reset cut |
| 7 | Stop guard | Stand | Return to defensive position |

#### DISTANCE DYNAMICS

**Initial Distance:** Opponent closing fast—moving from long to medium

**Your Response:**
- First quarter: Medium distance, check advance
- Pass left + quarter: Medium-close, pressure opponent
- Pass right + quarter: Close distance, dominate space
- Spring to knee: Extended close, exploit low opening
- Void back: Return to medium, maintain safety

**Result:** You've met aggression with aggression, struck low, and returned to safety—all while controlling the distance dynamic.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Spring Mechanics**
- Practice grip transition (two hands → one hand at pommel)
- Wall spring: face wall, spring thrust to specific point
- Measure extension: how much reach does spring add?
- Return to two hands smoothly after spring

**Week 2: Knee Targeting**
- Partner stands in guard
- Practice springing to partner's knee (controlled, no contact)
- Note how low-line target requires different angle
- Opponent's reactions: do they expect low attack?

**Week 3: Full Sequence (Slow)**
- Partner advances slowly
- Execute full Chase sequence
- Focus on passing steps coordinated with quarters
- Spring-void-quarter-stop combination

**Week 4: Speed and Pressure**
- Partner advances aggressively (no stopping)
- Execute Chase at combat speed
- Spring must genuinely threaten knee
- Void must create real safety

**Week 5+: Variations**
- Spring to different targets (foot, thigh, hip)
- Vary number of quarters (1, 2, or 3 before spring)
- Practice from different starting guards
- Experiment with cut vs. thrust spring

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Aggressive Fencers:**
This Chase is purpose-built for opponents who:
- Rush in without regard for defense
- Use overwhelming pressure tactics
- Expect you to retreat continuously
- Don't protect low-line

**Your Strategy:**
1. Meet initial aggression with quarter (don't flee)
2. Pass forward (surprise—you're advancing too)
3. Multiple quarters pressure their defense
4. Spring catches them off-guard (low, unexpected)
5. Void ensures safety regardless of success

**Psychological Impact:**
Aggressive opponents rely on fear. By advancing INTO their aggression, you:
- Disrupt their rhythm
- Force them to defend
- Demonstrate you won't be bullied
- Create doubt about their approach

#### SPRING VARIATIONS

**Spring to Cut (Alternative):**
Instead of thrusting to knee:
- Grip near pommel (same as thrust)
- Deliver rising cut to knee/shin
- Snapping motion with wrist
- Difficult to defend against (low, fast)

**Spring to Other Targets:**
- **Hand:** Opponent's lead hand extended
- **Wrist:** Joint vulnerable to spring thrust
- **Foot:** If opponent plants weight
- **Groin:** Higher risk but immediate fight-ender

**Two-Handed Spring (Alternative Interpretation):**
Some practitioners keep both hands on sword:
- Rear hand slides to pommel
- Front hand near crossguard
- Both hands drive spring
- More power, less reach than one-handed

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak first quarter—must genuinely threaten to check advance
- Passing steps too small—need to cover ground
- Spring with reach-hand instead of pommel-grip—reduces extension
- Spring too high—defeats purpose of low-line attack
- Not voiding far/fast enough—spring commits you forward
- Forgetting final stop guard—must return to defensive readiness

#### GEORGE SILVER CONNECTION

Silver wrote: "The shortest fight is the best fight. He that can make his distance true will find the time."[7]

The Eighth Chase demonstrates "making distance true":
- You don't flee aggression
- You meet it, control it, and capitalize
- The spring creates temporary distance advantage
- The void ensures you don't overcommit
- Return to stop guard maintains readiness

This is **active distance management** rather than passive retreat.

### CHAPTER 9: THE THIRTEENTH CHASE - "THE GETTING CHASE"

**Original Text:** *The xiijth Chace callyde the gettyng Chace a Sprynge upon a man In the lyffte Syde then paffe ov to the ryght Syde wyth an other Sprynge then paffe agayne to the lyffte Syde wyth a rake then voyde bake wyth a quartr*

**Modern English:** A Spring upon a man in the left side, then pass over to the right side with another Spring. Then pass again to the left side with a Rake, then void back with a Quarter.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Thirteenth Chase stands unique among surviving medieval sources: it explicitly addresses **fighting two opponents simultaneously**. The practitioner moves between threats using springs, staying mobile to prevent being flanked."[3]

> "The term 'getting' likely means 'gaining position' or 'getting between' multiple opponents. The constant passing left-right-left creates a defensive triangle where you're never stationary long enough to be pinned."[6]

**Key Points:**
- Multi-opponent tactics—extremely rare in period sources
- Springs to both sides maintain threat in multiple directions
- Rake on final pass—harassment cut while repositioning
- Void back with quarter creates escape route
- Movement is the defense—don't stay still

**Multi-Opponent Theory:**

Medieval combat manuals overwhelmingly address single combat. The "Getting Chase" is notable because it implies:

1. **Multiple Simultaneous Threats:** Opponents on left and right
2. **Positional Awareness:** Must track two opponents
3. **Continuous Movement:** Static position = surrounded
4. **Target Priority:** Springs to most dangerous opponent first
5. **Escape Planning:** Void creates exit route

#### STEP BREAKDOWN (SINGLE OPPONENT INTERPRETATION)

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Spring to left side | Stand | One-handed thrust/cut left |
| 2 | (Movement) | Pass to right side | Traverse across opponent |
| 3 | Spring to right side | Stand | One-handed thrust/cut right |
| 4 | (Movement) | Pass to left side | Return across opponent |
| 5 | Rake | Stand | Quick harassment cut |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back | Cut while retreating |

#### STEP BREAKDOWN (TWO OPPONENT INTERPRETATION)

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **SETUP** | Two opponents | One left, one right | You're between them |
| 1 | Spring at left opponent | Face left | Threaten/strike left enemy |
| 2 | (Pivot) | Pass to right | Turn to face right opponent |
| 3 | Spring at right opponent | Face right | Threaten/strike right enemy |
| 4 | (Pivot) | Pass to left | Return to left opponent |
| 5 | Rake at left opponent | Face left | Quick cut, maintain pressure |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back from both | Create distance, escape |

#### MULTI-OPPONENT TACTICAL PRINCIPLES

**1. Never Be Stationary:**
The moment you stop moving, both opponents can coordinate attacks. Constant movement prevents timing their strikes.

**2. Keep One in Line with the Other:**
Ideal position: both opponents are on same side of you (one behind the other). Your movement should create this alignment.

**3. Threat Maintenance:**
Spring to each opponent prevents them from feeling safe to attack. They must defend rather than coordinate offense.

**4. Create Escape Route:**
Final void back should be toward open space, not toward additional threats.

**5. Don't Commit Fully:**
Springs are threatening but don't overextend. Must be able to transition immediately.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Single Opponent Variant**
- One partner, practice passing left-right-left
- Spring to each side
- Focus on smooth transitions
- Final void + quarter

**Week 2: Add Second Opponent (Stationary)**
- Two partners stand left and right
- Practice springs to each
- Partners don't move or attack
- Focus on tracking both simultaneously

**Week 3: Active Opponents (Slow)**
- Two partners can move and attack slowly
- Execute Getting Chase at slow speed
- Partners coordinate to flank you
- Your movement prevents flanking

**Week 4: Pressure Testing**
- Partners attack at will
- You must respond with Getting Chase principles
- May need to deviate from exact sequence
- Goal: survive 30 seconds without being flanked

**Week 5+: Free Response**
- Partners attack unpredictably
- Use Getting Chase as template, not script
- Improvise based on opponent positions
- Develop instinct for multi-opponent movement

#### DETAILED MOVEMENT ANALYSIS

**Spring Left:**
- Face left opponent
- One-handed spring (pommel grip)
- Thrust to center mass or knee
- Right opponent temporarily behind you (vulnerable moment)
- Must be quick

**Pass to Right:**
- Pivot on right foot
- Left foot passes across
- Now facing right opponent
- Left opponent temporarily behind you
- Continuous motion

**Spring Right:**
- Face right opponent
- One-handed spring
- Maintain threat
- Left opponent again behind you briefly

**Pass to Left:**
- Pivot on left foot
- Right foot passes across
- Return to left opponent
- Creates triangle pattern

**Rake Left:**
- Quick cut (not power cut)
- Maintains pressure on left opponent
- Doesn't commit you dangerously

**Void Back + Quarter:**
- Step backward from both opponents
- Quarter cut threatens both
- Creates distance for next action or escape

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Street Fight Scenario:**
Medieval streets were narrow. Multiple attackers common. Getting Chase teaches:
- Don't get cornered
- Keep moving
- Threaten all attackers
- Create escape route

**Battlefield Application:**
In melee, could face opponents from multiple directions:
- Don't fixate on one enemy
- Maintain 360° awareness
- Quick strikes prevent coordination
- Disengage when possible

**Modern Tournament:**
While modern HEMA is 1v1, principles apply:
- Opponent cutting angles from both sides
- Need to address multiple attack lines
- Movement superior to static defense
- Create angles, don't stand square

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Fixating on one opponent—must track both
- Passing steps too small—need significant traverse
- Springs too committed—must stay mobile
- Forgetting final void—creates escape route
- Mechanical execution—must adapt to opponent positions
- Telegraphing next movement—be unpredictable

#### WHY THIS CHASE MATTERS

The existence of the Getting Chase reveals important historical realities:

**1. Self-Defense Focus:**
English martial arts prioritized **survival over dueling**. Multiple attackers were real threat.

**2. Practical Approach:**
This isn't sport fencing—it's life-or-death street survival.

**3. Movement Over Binding:**
Continental sources emphasize blade work (winding). English emphasizes **footwork and positioning**.

**4. Completeness of System:**
The Ledall Roll isn't just techniques—it's a comprehensive fighting system addressing varied scenarios.

#### GEORGE SILVER'S MULTI-OPPONENT ADVICE

Though writing 50+ years later, Silver's *Paradoxes* includes multi-opponent tactics:

> "Against two or more, keep them in line so that one protects you from the other. Move continuously so they cannot coordinate their strikes."[7]

The Getting Chase embodies these principles decades before Silver codified them.

## PART III: THE COUNTERS (POINTS)

The twenty-three Counters represent **defensive plays responding to specific situations**. As Mark Ryan Geldof discovered, the manuscript presents them out of sequence (1-3, then 22-23, then 4-21), requiring modern editors to resequence logically.[6]

Unlike the Chases (which are training sequences) or Flourishes (solo forms), the Counters are **tactical responses**—specific techniques for specific problems. They consistently end with "quarter-and-void" combinations, creating safety after the counter-attack.

Brandon Heslop notes: "The Counters embody George Silver's later principles about managing measure. They're conservative by design—strike, create distance, return to guard. This reduces double-hits and prioritizes survival."[3]

### Counter Structure

Most Counters follow this pattern:
1. **Proffer** (feinted opening or invitation)
2. **Defensive Action** (rake, rabett, parry)
3. **Counter-Strike** (quarter, spring, thrust)
4. **Safety Creation** (void, quarter-and-void)
5. **Return to Stop** (defensive guard)

---

### CHAPTER 10: THE SECOND COUNTER - "THE FULL-SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The Seconde callyde the full Sprynge a Proffer a rake wyth a quartr. then paffe fprynge wt yor hand by yor bonwarde forwarde and be att yor Stoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter. Then pass, spring with your hand by your pommel-ward forward and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Full-Spring deploys the extended one-handed attack as a defensive measure—creating distance while threatening simultaneously. It's the English answer to the question: 'How do I keep an aggressive opponent at bay?'"[3]

**Key Points:**
- **Proffer** = feinted offering/opening (invites opponent's attack)
- Rake + Quarter = harassment combination
- **Full-Spring** = maximum one-handed extension
- "By your pommel-ward" = grip near pommel for reach
- Pass forward = advance while springing (aggressive defense)
- Immediate return to stop (safety)

**The Proffer Technique:**

The "proffer" appears throughout the Counters. It's a **deliberate opening** designed to draw opponent's attack:

1. **Expose Target:** Leave opening (high line, low line, or specific side)
2. **Appear Vulnerable:** Opponent believes opening is unintentional
3. **Opponent Commits:** They attack the "opening"
4. **Execute Counter:** You were ready—it was trap

Modern equivalent: **feint** or **baited opening**

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Create baited opening |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks opening | Advances | Falls for trap |
| 2 | Rake | Stand or slight void | Harassment cut to hands/arms |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | Follow-up cut |
| 4 | (Grip adjustment) | Pass forward | Slide to pommel grip |
| 5 | Full-Spring | Extended stance | Maximum reach thrust/cut |
| 6 | Stop Guard | Recover | Return to defensive position |

#### THE FULL-SPRING MECHANIC

**What Makes It "Full":**
- **Maximum Extension:** Hand at very end of pommel
- **Full Body Commitment:** Weight shifts completely forward
- **One-Handed:** Rear hand off sword entirely (or very light grip)
- **Complete Reach:** 12-24" beyond normal reach

**Grip Detail:**
1. Both hands on sword initially
2. During pass forward, rear hand slides down haft
3. Rear hand grips pommel's end
4. Front hand may release or provide minimal guidance
5. All driving power comes from rear hand at pommel

**Body Mechanics:**
- Weight fully on front leg
- Rear leg extended for push-off
- Torso leaning forward
- Arm fully extended
- Like lunging in modern fencing but one-handed

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent presses forward aggressively
- Need to create distance quickly
- Opponent doesn't respect your reach
- Want to maintain offensive threat while defending

**Why It Works:**
- Unexpected reach surprises opponent
- They commit to attack, you counter at extended range
- One-handed allows maximum extension
- Pass forward while springing creates momentum
- Immediate stop guard prevents counter-attack

**Psychological Impact:**
Full-spring demonstrates:
- You control the distance
- Their aggression won't work
- You're willing to meet force with force
- You have tools they didn't expect

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Proffer Practice**
- Partner observes as you create openings
- High-line proffer: raise hands, expose low
- Low-line proffer: lower hands, expose high
- Side proffer: angle body, expose flank
- Partner identifies when opening appears genuine

**Week 2: Rake-Quarter Combination**
- Partner attacks your proffer
- Execute rake to their attacking hand/sword
- Immediate quarter cut
- Focus on timing—must be instantaneous
- No gap between rake and quarter

**Week 3: Spring Mechanics**
- Practice full-spring against wall/target
- Measure reach: normal vs. full-spring
- Document difference (should be 12-24")
- Practice passing forward while springing
- Smooth grip transition to pommel

**Week 4: Integration**
- Full sequence with partner
- Partner attacks proffer
- You execute rake-quarter-pass-spring
- Return to stop guard
- Repeat with different proffers

**Week 5+: Pressure Testing**
- Partner attacks unpredictably
- You must create proffer naturally
- Execute full counter at speed
- Spring must genuinely threaten
- Stop guard must be immediate and solid

#### PROFFER VARIATIONS

**High-Line Proffer:**
- Raise hands/sword above head
- Exposes lower body
- Invites low attacks
- Counter: rake hands as they attack low, spring to face

**Low-Line Proffer:**
- Drop hands/sword toward ground
- Exposes upper body
- Invites high attacks
- Counter: rake descending cut, spring to chest

**Side Proffer:**
- Angle body, expose flank
- Invites attacks to open side
- Counter: rake across, spring forward

**Distance Proffer:**
- Stand just out of range
- Appear vulnerable but aren't
- Invites over-committed advance
- Counter: rake as they extend, spring catches them mid-advance

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Obvious proffer—opponent doesn't bite
- Weak rake—must genuinely threaten
- Pause between rake and quarter—must be continuous
- Insufficient grip slide—hand not at pommel
- Not passing forward—full-spring requires forward momentum
- Overextending on spring—must maintain balance
- Forgetting stop guard—leaves you vulnerable

#### DEFENSIVE PHILOSOPHY

The Second Counter embodies English defensive philosophy:

**Not Passive Defense:**
- Don't wait and react
- Create opportunity (proffer)
- Control opponent's action
- Counter decisively

**Offense-Defense Integration:**
- Rake is defensive AND offensive
- Quarter maintains pressure
- Full-spring creates distance AND threatens
- Stop guard prepares next action

**Distance Management:**
- Proffer controls when opponent engages
- Rake controls their attack
- Spring creates distance advantage
- Stop maintains safe distance

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: THE PROFFER

Terry Brown notes in his English Martial Arts research: "The 'proffer' or 'preferment' was well-known in Elizabethan England as a fencing tactic. It appears in multiple sources and refers to deliberately offering an opening to draw opponent's attack."[8]

George Silver later wrote: "The best defense is to offer that which you wish to protect, for the fool will strike at what is offered rather than what is guarded."[7]

The Ledall Roll's extensive use of proffers suggests this was core English tactic decades before Silver codified it in writing.

### CHAPTER 11: THE TENTH COUNTER - "THE SNATCH"

**Original Text:** *The xth callyde the Snatche A profur a rake wyth a quarter full voydyng bake the ryght legge wt ye lyffte honde ſmyte A ſnatche then voyde bake yor lyffte legge And be att youre Stoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter full. Voiding back the right leg with the left hand smite a Snatch, then void back your left leg and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Snatch is a snapping cut from pendant guard, related to the German *Schnappen*. It's delivered with the left (forward) hand only, creating a surprise attack from an unusual position."[3]

> "This technique addresses the challenge of recovering from overextension. You've voided back, you're one-handed, but you still need to maintain offensive threat—the snatch does exactly that."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Starts with standard proffer-rake-quarter pattern
- Void back creates distance
- **Snatch** = one-handed snap cut with forward hand
- Pendant guard = sword hanging behind/beside body, point down
- Second void ensures safety
- Two-stage retreat (right leg, then left leg)

**The Snatch Technique:**

**Position:**
- Sword in pendant (hanging) position
- Point low or behind body
- Forward (left) hand grips normally
- Rear (right) hand released or very light grip

**Execution:**
1. From pendant, sword hangs relaxed
2. Sudden wrist snap upward
3. Blade accelerates from gravity-assisted position
4. Strikes rising line (hands, arms, head)
5. Immediately returns to pendant

**Why "Snatch":**
- Motion resembles snatching/grabbing
- Quick grab-like movement
- Sudden and surprising
- From low to high in one snap

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Bait opening |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Harassment cut to hands |
| 3 | Quarter full | Stand | "Full" = committed cut |
| 4 | (Release rear hand) | Void back right leg | Transition to one-handed |
| 5 | Snatch | Stand | One-handed snap cut (left hand) |
| 6 | (Return to two hands) | Void back left leg | Second retreat |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### PENDANT GUARD ANALYSIS

The pendant guard is explicitly mentioned in multiple Counters. Understanding it is key:

**Historical Names:**
- English: "Pendant" (hanging)
- German: *Nebenhut* (side guard) or related to *Alber*
- Italian: *Posta de coda lunga* (tail guard long)

**Position Details:**
- Sword behind body or beside
- Point angled downward
- Hands low (hip or below)
- Weight distributed evenly or on rear leg

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Deceptive—appears non-threatening
- Hides sword length from opponent
- Loads energy for snap cuts (gravity-assisted)
- Difficult to read intentions

**Transitions:**
- FROM pendant: snatch, rising cuts, thrusts
- TO pendant: after overextended attacks, during voids

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Snatch Mechanics**
- Practice pendant position
- One-handed snap cuts from pendant
- Focus on wrist motion, not arm
- Target rising line (waist to head)
- Develop speed and snap

**Week 2: Integration with Void**
- Practice void back right leg
- Transition to pendant during void
- Snatch immediately after void
- Focus on continuous motion

**Week 3: Full Sequence**
- Start with proffer
- Partner attacks
- Rake-quarter-void-snatch
- Second void-stop guard
- Emphasize rhythm and flow

**Week 4+: Tactical Application**
- Use snatch to surprise opponent
- Execute after overcommitted attacks
- Practice with various pendant positions
- Develop instinct for snatch timing

#### SNATCH TARGETS

**Primary Targets:**
- **Hands/Wrists:** Opponent extended after attack
- **Forearms:** As they recover
- **Head:** If opponent leans forward
- **Sword Hand:** If they maintain extension

**Why These Targets:**
- All in rising line from pendant
- Opponent may not expect low-to-high attack
- Snatch from pendant difficult to defend
- Minimal telegraph

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**After Overextension:**
You've committed to attack, voided back, now what?
- Snatch maintains offensive threat
- Prevents opponent from pressing advantage
- Creates doubt about your recovery

**Against Pursuit:**
Opponent follows your retreat:
- First void creates distance
- Snatch discourages pursuit
- Second void ensures safety
- Opponent learns to respect your retreat

**Surprise Element:**
Opponent expects:
- Two-handed recovery
- Defensive posture after retreat
- Standard attacks

Opponent doesn't expect:
- One-handed attack
- Low-to-high angle
- Speed from pendant

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak snatch—must have snap/speed
- Arm movement instead of wrist snap—reduces speed
- Not fully releasing rear hand—limits pendant depth
- Telegraphing snatch—pendant should appear natural
- Insufficient void distance—snatch should be from safety
- Not returning to two hands—leaves you vulnerable
- Forgetting second void—pattern requires it

#### GERMAN *SCHNAPPEN* COMPARISON

The German *Schnappen* (snapping cut) shares characteristics:

**Similarities:**
- Snap/grab-like motion
- Often from low guards
- Rising angle common
- Speed over power
- Surprise element

**Differences:**
- German: Can be two-handed
- English: Explicitly one-handed in Tenth Counter
- German: Multiple guards
- English: Specifically from pendant

**Technical Exchange:**
Possible that English and German fencers shared techniques, or convergent evolution of similar tactical needs.

#### PENDANT GUARD DRILLS

**Solo Practice:**
1. Assume pendant guard
2. Execute 10 snatches (rising line)
3. Vary targets: hands, forearms, head
4. Focus on wrist snap
5. Maintain balance throughout

**Partner Drill:**
1. Partner extends attack
2. You void back to pendant
3. Execute snatch to partner's extended hand
4. Partner learns to respect snatch
5. Switch roles

**Flow Drill:**
1. Exchange attacks
2. Whoever retreats can snatch
3. Builds instinct for snatch timing
4. Develops tactical awareness

### CHAPTER 12: THE TWENTY-SECOND COUNTER - "THE LARGE PROFFER WITH A RABETT"

**Original Text:** *The xxijth callyd ye Large proffer wt a rabett and the for quarter. Void back ye ryght legge Smyte rabett att ye same hand playng ye rabett then Standyng Styll breke ye same rabett Smyte a full Spryng at hys legge wt a full quarter and an other quarter A voyde be att yor Stoppe*

**Modern English:** Void back and start to play a Rabett, breaking the Rabett to strike a Full-Spring at his leg with a full Quarter, and another Quarter and a Quarter void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Rabett (rabbit) describes countercuts against the opponent's weapon—defensive cutting actions that establish favorable positions for follow-up attacks, similar to the German *Dempfhau*. The 'Large Proffer' suggests a very obvious, exaggerated opening designed to draw committed attacks."[3]

> "This Counter demonstrates advanced tactics: feint the rabett (start it, don't complete it), then exploit the opening created by their response with a spring. It's deception layered on deception."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Large Proffer** = exaggerated, obvious opening
- **Rabett** = countercut against opponent's weapon
- "Start to play" the rabett = begin but don't complete (feint)
- "Breaking the rabett" = abort/redirect the action
- Full-spring to leg = capitalize on opening
- Triple quarter sequence ensures safety

**The Rabett Technique:**

The Rabett appears throughout the Counters and deserves detailed explanation:

**What It Is:**
- Cut delivered against opponent's attacking blade
- Defensive in purpose, offensive in execution
- Creates percussion/impact on their sword
- Deflects their attack while positioning for counter

**How It Works:**
1. Opponent attacks
2. You cut against their blade (not past it)
3. Impact displaces their sword
4. You maintain or gain centerline
5. Immediate counter-attack available

**Why "Rabett" (Rabbit):**
Unclear etymology. Theories:
- Quick, darting motion like rabbit
- "Rebate"—to beat back/reduce
- Corruption of French term
- Original meaning lost

**German Equivalent:**
*Dempfhau* (damping cut) serves similar function—striking opponent's sword to displace it.

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Large Proffer | Stand | Very obvious opening |
| **OPPONENT** | Committed attack | Advances | Takes bait aggressively |
| 2 | Start rabett | Void back right leg | Begin countercut (feint) |
| 3 | Break rabett | Stand | Abort the rabett mid-motion |
| 4 | Full-spring to leg | Extended stance | Capitalize on opponent's response |
| 5 | Quarter full | Stand | First safety cut |
| 6 | Quarter | Stand | Second safety cut |
| 7 | Quarter void | Void back | Third cut while retreating |
| 8 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### THE LARGE PROFFER TACTIC

**What Makes It "Large":**
- Exaggerated opening
- Obviously vulnerable position
- Almost insulting in appearance
- Designed to trigger aggressive response

**Purpose:**
- Draw overcommitted attack
- Opponent thinks: "Finally, clear opening!"
- They attack harder/faster than usual
- Sets up your counter perfectly

**Risk:**
- If opponent doesn't bite, you're exposed
- If they recognize trap, they counter
- Requires confidence to maintain

**Examples:**
- Drop hands very low (exposes head)
- Turn sideways (exposes back)
- Look away momentarily (appears distracted)
- Step back as if retreating (appears fearful)

#### RABETT FEINT ("START TO PLAY" / "BREAKING")

The sophisticated element of this Counter:

**Standard Rabett:**
- Opponent attacks
- You rabett (countercut their blade)
- You follow with counter-attack

**This Counter's Rabett:**
- Opponent attacks large proffer
- You START rabett (opponent sees it coming)
- You BREAK rabett (abort mid-execution)
- Opponent reacts to rabett (defends/adjusts)
- You spring to leg (unexpected angle)

**Why This Works:**
1. Large proffer draws attack
2. Opponent sees you beginning rabett
3. They prepare for rabett (raise hands, adjust guard)
4. You abort rabett and spring low
5. Their defense is high, your attack is low
6. They can't adjust in time

**This is double-deception:**
- First deception: Large proffer (fake vulnerability)
- Second deception: Rabett feint (fake counter)
- Actual attack: Spring to leg

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Rabett Mechanics**
- Practice standard rabett
- Partner attacks (slow)
- You countercut their blade
- Feel the impact/displacement
- Immediate follow-up attack

**Week 2: Rabett Feint**
- Begin rabett motion
- Stop halfway through
- Redirect to different target
- Partner observes the feint
- Discuss: could they tell?

**Week 3: Large Proffer**
- Create exaggerated openings
- Partner identifies when it looks "too obvious"
- Find balance: obvious enough to draw attack, subtle enough to seem real
- Test various proffer types

**Week 4: Integration (Slow)**
- Full sequence at 25% speed
- Large proffer → partner attacks
- Void + start rabett
- Break rabett → spring to leg
- Triple quarter sequence

**Week 5: Pressure Testing**
- Increase speed to 50-75%
- Partner attacks committed
- You must execute deceptions convincingly
- Spring must genuinely threaten
- Quarters must create real safety

**Week 6+: Tactical Application**
- Use in free fencing
- Test if opponent bites on large proffer
- Develop sense for when to break rabett
- Build instinct for spring timing

#### TRIPLE QUARTER SAFETY SEQUENCE

The ending "full quarter, another quarter, quarter void" is notable:

**Why Three Quarters:**
- **First (Full):** Committed cut, real threat
- **Second:** Maintains pressure if first blocked
- **Third (Void):** Retreat while attacking, maximum safety

**This Demonstrates:**
English philosophy: Don't stop attacking until you've created safety. Three quarters ensure:
1. Opponent can't immediately counter
2. You control the distance
3. You maintain initiative
4. You return to guard safely

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent is aggressive and impulsive
- They attack obvious openings without thought
- You need to teach them to respect your traps
- Late in bout when opponent is tired/frustrated

**Setup Requirements:**
- Must sell the large proffer convincingly
- Opponent must be conditioned to attack openings
- You must have practiced rabett feint extensively
- Spring to leg must be committed and threatening

**Psychological Impact:**
This Counter is **humiliating** when it works:
1. Opponent falls for large proffer (feels foolish)
2. Sees your rabett coming (thinks they can counter)
3. Rabett disappears, spring hits leg (complete surprise)
4. Three quarters prevent any response (dominated)

Opponent learns: "I can't trust anything they show me."

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Proffer not exaggerated enough—opponent doesn't bite
- Proffer too obvious—opponent recognizes trap
- Weak rabett start—opponent doesn't react to it
- Not committing to break—half-hearted feint fails
- Spring to leg lacks commitment—doesn't threaten
- Only two quarters instead of three—reduces safety
- Forgetting stop guard—leaves vulnerable

#### ADVANCED VARIATIONS

**Rabett Commitment Variation:**
- Complete the rabett instead of breaking it
- If opponent doesn't react to rabett start
- Shows adaptability—script isn't rigid

**Multiple Proffers:**
- First proffer: Small (they ignore)
- Second proffer: Medium (they hesitate)
- Third proffer: Large (they finally bite)
- Conditions them to attack progressively larger openings

**Spring Target Variation:**
- Alternate between knee, ankle, shin
- Opponent can't predict exact target
- All are low-line, hard to defend

#### HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE

The Twenty-Second Counter represents **peak sophistication** of English longsword:

**Multiple Layers:**
1. Tactical (large proffer)
2. Technical (rabett)
3. Psychological (feint)
4. Strategic (spring to leg)
5. Defensive (triple quarter)

This isn't simple technique—it's **high-level martial chess**.

George Silver later wrote: "The mind defeats the body before the blade defeats the flesh."[7] This Counter proves that principle—it's primarily psychological warfare.

## CONCLUSION: THE LEDALL ROLL AS COMPLETE FIGHTING SYSTEM

The Ledall Roll manuscript, though brief and text-only, reveals a **sophisticated and complete longsword system** addressing:

**Technical Fundamentals:**
- Flourishes (solo training forms)
- Basic guards and transitions
- Offensive techniques (quarters, rakes, springs, foynes)
- Defensive techniques (rabetts, displacements, voids)

**Tactical Applications:**
- Chases (training sequences and combinations)
- Counters (defensive responses to specific attacks)
- Multi-opponent tactics (Getting Chase)
- Proffer and feint strategies

**Strategic Principles:**
- Distance management (voids, springs)
- Initiative maintenance (continuous pressure)
- Safety prioritization (quarter-void combinations)
- Psychological warfare (proffers, feints, deceptions)

**Pedagogical Structure:**
- Progressive difficulty (Flourishes → Chases → Counters)
- Repetitive training (traveling patterns return to start)
- Partner and solo practice (different Chase interpretations)
- Comprehensive coverage (offense, defense, multiple opponents)

### How This Guide Should Be Used

**Beginners (Months 1-3):**
1. Master the three Flourishes
2. Learn First Chase thoroughly
3. Understand basic terminology
4. Practice springs and rabetts in isolation
5. Build conditioning and muscle memory

**Intermediate (Months 4-9):**
1. Progress through Chases 1-7
2. Begin simple Counters (Second, Tenth)
3. Practice partner drills
4. Develop proffer tactics
5. Begin free fencing with taught techniques

**Advanced (Months 10+):**
1. Master all Chases including Getting Chase
2. Study complex Counters (Twenty-Second)
3. Develop tactical sophistication
4. Teach techniques to others
5. Research and experiment with interpretations

### The English Longsword Legacy

The Ledall Roll bridges Medieval English martial arts (Harleian MS, Cotton Titus) and Renaissance codification (George Silver). It demonstrates that English longsword was:

- **Not inferior** to continental systems
- **Sophisticated** in tactics and technique
- **Complete** in addressing combat scenarios
- **Practical** in prioritizing survival

Modern practitioners have a duty to:
- Study these techniques seriously
- Test interpretations through practice
- Share findings with the community
- Preserve this cultural heritage

### Final Thought

Brandon Heslop concludes his book: "We may never know exactly how Medieval Englishmen fought with longsword, but through careful study, thoughtful interpretation, and honest practice, we can approach that knowledge. The Ledall Roll is our best guide—use it well."[3]

## APPENDIX C: COMMON MISTAKES & CORRECTIONS

**MISTAKE:** Gripping too far forward on springs
**CORRECTION:** Hand should be at or near pommel for maximum reach

**MISTAKE:** Power-cutting rakes instead of quick harassment
**CORRECTION:** Rakes are light, fast, wrist-driven—think harassment, not damage

**MISTAKE:** Pausing between rake and quarter in Counters
**CORRECTION:** These should flow as one continuous motion

**MISTAKE:** Obvious/theatrical proffers that don't fool anyone
**CORRECTION:** Proffers should look like genuine mistakes/openings

**MISTAKE:** Not voiding far enough on retreat
**CORRECTION:** Void steps should create significant distance (2-3 feet minimum)

**MISTAKE:** Forgetting "stop guard" endings
**CORRECTION:** Every sequence ends in defensive guard—never finish exposed

**MISTAKE:** Treating Chases as combat applications
**CORRECTION:** Chases are training sequences—learn principles, then apply tactically

**MISTAKE:** Mechanical execution without tactical understanding
**CORRECTION:** Every technique has "why"—study the purpose, not just the motion

**MISTAKE:** Only practicing solo
**CORRECTION:** Partner work is essential for distance, timing, tactical awareness

**MISTAKE:** Rushing through material
**CORRECTION:** Master each technique before progressing—quality over quantity
