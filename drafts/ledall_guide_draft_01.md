## SPECIAL TECHNIQUES

### **The Stopping Rabett**

**Original:** *The Å¿toppyng Rabett alfo Å¿tandyng att yor defence yff you bepayste youre Enmy when he begynyth to play A profur lyghtly Å¿ett in yor lyffte legge wt a Rabett voydyng Bake voydyng bake the fame legge be at your Å¿topp. Other els when yor Emny playethe A pfur wt a Rake and be gynyth to pluke bake hys Å¿werde to Å¿ete a quartr lyghtly Å¿ette in your lyffte legge wyth ye Å¿ayde Rabett then voyde bake the Å¿ame legge and be att youre Å¿toppe.*

**Modernized:** Also, standing at your defence, if you bepayste (deceive) your Enemy: when he begins to play a Proffer, lightly set in your left leg with a Rabett, voiding back the same leg be at your stop. Otherwise, when your Enemy plays a Proffer and begins to pluck back his sword to set a Quarter lightly set in your left leg with the said Rabett, then void back the same leg and be at your stop.

**Step-by-Step Training Guide:**
**Scenario 1: Opponent begins Proffer**
1. Standing in guard
2. When opponent starts Proffer: Step in with left leg (quick) + Rabett
3. Step back with left leg (same leg)
4. Return to guard

**Scenario 2: Opponent does Proffer + Rake, pulls back for Quarter**
1. Standing in guard
2. Watch opponent's Proffer + Rake
3. When opponent pulls back sword to prepare Quarter: Step in with left leg (quick) + Rabett
4. Step back with left leg
5. Return to guard

**Training Notes:**
- This is a COUNTER technique - reactive, not proactive
- "Stopping Rabett" interrupts opponent's action
- Timing is critical - catch them between moves
- "Bepayste" = deceive/trick them
- Same-leg advance-retreat pattern
- Quick in-and-out motion
- Partner drill essential for timing practice

### **The Dragon's Tail with the Pendant**

**Original:** *The dragonys tayle wt the pendante A profor wt a Rake Å¿tondyng Å¿tyll wt your ryght honde ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede and as the Å¿werde wavyth a bowte. Our your hede Å¿ett in youre lyffte fote then lyghtly, wyth the Ryght honde and foote throÅ¿te forth A foyne at hys face and throÅ¿te a bowe foyne att hys bely then Å¿myte a full quatr And an other voyde And be att youre Stoppe.*

**Modernized:** A Proffer, with a Rake, standing still with your right hand play a void quarter above his head, and as the sword waves about, over your head, set in your left foot. Then lightly, with the right hand and foot, thrust forth a thrust at his face, and thrust a Bow-thrust at his belly. Then smite a full Quarter, and another void, and be at your stop.

**Step-by-Step Training Guide:**
1. Proffer + Rake
2. Standing still: Right hand - void Quarter above head
3. As sword circles/waves overhead: Step in with left foot
4. Right hand and foot (quick): Thrust to face
5. Bow-thrust to belly
6. Full Quarter
7. Void
8. Return to guard

**Training Notes:**
- "Dragon's Tail" is the circular overhead motion
- "Pendant" is likely the guard/position you transition to
- One-handed control (right hand) while moving
- Circular motion creates momentum for thrusts
- High-low thrust combination (face then belly)
- "Bow-thrust" is a specific thrust type (possibly arcing)
- Complex coordination of hand/foot timing
- Practice the overhead circle separately
- This appears in the Second Flourish as well
