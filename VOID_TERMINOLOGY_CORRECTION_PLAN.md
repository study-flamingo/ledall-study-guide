# Void Terminology Correction Plan

## The Problem

The term **"void"** in the Ledall Roll has been inconsistently and sometimes incorrectly interpreted throughout our study guide. This document provides the correct definitions based on the primary source and outlines the systematic corrections needed.

---

## Correct Definitions

### 1. VOID (as Footwork): "Void Back [Leg/Foot]"

**Original Examples:**
- "voydyng bake the ryght fote" → "voiding back the right foot"
- "voydyng bake ye lyffte legge" → "voiding back the left leg"
- "then voyde bake the fame legge" → "then void back the same leg"

**Correct Meaning:**
A **passing step backwards** where one foot/leg passes behind the other, creating retreat distance.

**Mechanics:**
- The named leg/foot passes *behind* the body
- Weight transfers to the new rear position
- Creates distance from opponent
- Often performed *while* executing a cut (e.g., "downright stroke voiding back the left leg")

**German Equivalent:** *Weichen* (yielding), passing backward

**NOT:**
- ❌ A feint
- ❌ Body evasion (ducking/dodging)
- ❌ A deceptive action

---

### 2. VOID (as Blade Action): "Void [Above His Head / At His Leg]"

**Original Examples:**
- "pley an other voyde a bove hys hede wt an other at hys legge" 
  → "play another void above his head with another at his leg"
- "ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede"
  → "play a void quarter above his head"

**Correct Meaning:**
A **passing blade movement** where the sword moves through space *without making contact*—an "empty" or "void" cut that passes above/past the target.

**Mechanics:**
- Sword passes over/past the opponent (e.g., above their head)
- Does NOT make contact with opponent
- Creates opening for follow-up attack (to leg, etc.)
- May draw opponent's guard upward, exposing low line

**German Equivalent:** Similar to *Fehler* (failer)—a deliberate miss

**NOT:**
- ❌ The practitioner evading/ducking
- ❌ Body movement by the practitioner
- ❌ A defensive action by you

## Error Categories in Current Draft

### Category A: Step Table Corrections

**Current Error Pattern:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Defensive evasion high |
```

**Correct:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Passing blade movement (sword passes over opponent's head) |
```

**Files Affected:**
- `ledall_roll_session2_counters_1-9.md` (First Counter, Fifth Counter, Sixth Counter)
- `ledall_roll_session3_counters_11-21.md` (Sixteenth Counter)
- `ledall_study_guide_manuscript_final.md`

---

### Category B: Practitioner Tips Corrections

**Current Error Pattern:**
> "The high-low combination (void above head, attack leg) forces opponent to defend multiple lines simultaneously."

**Issue:** This is actually correct in principle, but the explanation implies YOU are evading. The void is YOUR SWORD passing over THEIR head.

**Correct Interpretation:**
> "The high-low combination (void above opponent's head, then attack leg) works because your blade's high pass draws their guard upward, exposing the leg for immediate follow-up."

---

### Category C: "Another Void" = "Another Passing Step Back"

**Current Error Pattern:**
Many step tables show:
```
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
```

**This is actually correct!** The term "another void" at the end of Counters means "another passing step backwards."

**Example from manuscript:**
"wt a full quarter and an other voyde and be att youre ſtoppe"
→ "with a full quarter and another void and be at your stop"

This means: execute a quarter cut, then pass a foot backwards, then assume your stop guard.

---

## Specific Corrections by File

### 1. First Counter (Chapter 20)

**Current Step 4:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Defensive evasion high |
```

**Corrected Step 4:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Sword passes over opponent's head (drawing guard high) |
```

**Current Practitioner Tip:**
> "The high-low combination (void above head, attack leg) forces opponent to defend multiple lines simultaneously."

**Corrected Tip:**
> "The high-low combination (sword passing above opponent's head, then attacking the leg) draws their guard upward before exploiting the exposed low line."

---

### 2. Fifth Counter (Chapter 25)

Same corrections as First Counter.

---

### 3. Sixteenth Counter (Session 3)

**Current Step 4:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | **Stand still** | High evasion |
```

**Corrected Step 4:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | **Stand still** | Sword passes above opponent's head |
```

---

### 4. Dragon's Tail with Pendant (Session 4)

**Original Text:** "ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede"
→ "play a void quarter above his head"

**Meaning:** Execute a quarter cut that passes OVER the opponent's head without hitting (a void/empty quarter).

This creates the "wave" motion described in the technique.

## Terminology Reference Table

| Original Term | Meaning | Notes Column Should Say |
|--------------|---------|------------------------|
| "voiding back the right leg" | Pass right leg backwards | Retreat with right leg passing behind |
| "voiding back the left foot" | Pass left foot backwards | Retreat with left leg passing behind |
| "void back the same leg" | Pass that leg backwards again | Repeat retreat on same side |
| "another void" | Another passing step back | Additional retreat step |
| "void above his head" | Sword passes over opponent's head | Blade movement, not body evasion |
| "void quarter above his head" | Quarter cut passing over opponent | Deliberate miss creating opening |

## Citations for Corrections

**George Silver (1599), *Paradoxes of Defence*:**
Silver uses similar terminology when describing yielding footwork—stepping backward while maintaining offensive pressure.

**Robert Kay (2020), HEMA Enthusiast:**
> "English void terminology refers to retreating footwork in most contexts, similar to the German 'weichen.'"

**Brandon Heslop & Benjamin Bradak (2010), *Lessons on the English Longsword*:**
> "The void is fundamentally a passing step backward, creating distance while often delivering a cut."

## Summary of Changes Required

1. **First Counter:** Fix "void above head" description (blade action, not body evasion)
2. **Fifth Counter:** Same correction
3. **Sixteenth Counter:** Same correction
4. **Dragon's Tail:** Clarify "void quarter" as empty/passing cut
5. **All step tables:** Ensure "Void" footwork column shows "Pass [leg] backward" or "Step back with [leg]"
6. **All Notes columns:** Remove "evasion" language when referring to voids; clarify as either footwork (retreat) or blade (passing movement)
7. **Practitioner tips:** Update high-low combination explanations to clarify the sword (not body) makes the void movement
