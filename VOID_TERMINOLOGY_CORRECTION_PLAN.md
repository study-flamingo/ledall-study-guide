# Void Terminology Correction Plan

## The Problem

The term **"void"** in the Ledall Roll has been incorrectly interpreted as a feint or body evasion throughout our study guide. This document provides the correct definition based on the primary source and outlines the systematic corrections needed.

---

## Correct Definition

### VOID = Passing Step Backwards (Always Footwork)

**Original Examples:**
- "voydyng bake the ryght fote" → "voiding back the right foot"
- "voydyng bake ye lyffte legge" → "voiding back the left leg"
- "then voyde bake the fame legge" → "then void back the same leg"
- "pley a voyde quartr a boue hys hede" → "play a void quarter above his head"

**Correct Meaning:**
A **passing step backwards** where one foot/leg passes behind the other, creating retreat distance. When combined with a cut, it means performing that cut WHILE retreating.

**Mechanics:**
- The named leg/foot passes *behind* the body
- Weight transfers to the new rear position
- Creates distance from opponent
- Often performed *while* executing a cut (e.g., "downright stroke voiding back the left leg")

**German Equivalent:** *Weichen* (yielding), passing backward

**NOT:**
- ❌ A feint
- ❌ Body evasion (ducking/dodging)
- ❌ A deceptive blade action
- ❌ An "empty" cut that misses

### Key Phrase Interpretations

| Phrase | Correct Meaning |
|--------|----------------|
| "void back the right leg" | Pass right leg backwards (retreat) |
| "void quarter above his head" | Quarter cut aimed high, delivered WHILE stepping back |
| "void above his head with another at his leg" | Cut high while voiding, then cut low |
| "another void" | Another passing step backwards |
| "quartering and voiding" | Attacking while retreating |

This embodies the English principle: **attack while retreating** for safety. The void creates distance while the cut maintains offensive pressure.

---

## Error Categories in Current Draft

### Category A: Step Table Corrections (Footwork Column)

**Current Error Pattern:**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Defensive evasion high |
```

**Problem:** Footwork says "Stand" but void IS footwork (stepping back). Notes say "evasion" which is wrong.

**Correct:**
```
| 4 | Quarter above head | Void (pass leg back) | High cut while retreating |
```

**Files Affected:**
- `ledall_roll_session2_counters_1-9.md` (First Counter, Fifth Counter)
- `ledall_roll_session3_counters_11-21.md` (Sixteenth Counter)
- `ledall_study_guide_manuscript_final.md`

---

### Category B: Practitioner Tips Corrections

**Current Error Pattern:**
> "The high-low combination (void above head, attack leg) forces opponent to defend multiple lines simultaneously."

**Issue:** The description implies "void" is a separate evasive action. The void is footwork happening DURING the cuts.

**Correct Interpretation:**
> "The high-low combination (cut above head while voiding back, then cut to leg) works because you attack high, retreat for safety, then exploit the opening low."

---

### Category C: "Another Void" = Correct!

Many step tables show:
```
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
```

**This is correct!** The term "another void" at the end of Counters means another passing step backwards.

**Example from manuscript:**
"wt a full quarter and an other voyde and be att youre ſtoppe"
→ "with a full quarter and another void and be at your stop"

This means: execute a quarter cut, then pass a foot backwards, then assume your stop guard.

---

### Category D: Misidentifying Void as Blade Action

**Current Error Pattern:**
Treating "void above his head" as if the BLADE is doing the voiding (like a feint or empty cut).

**Correct Understanding:**
The FEET do the voiding (stepping back). The cut happens to be aimed "above his head" during that retreat.

---

## Specific Corrections by File

### 1. First Counter (Chapter 20) — MAJOR REWRITE

**Current Step Table (Wrong):**
```
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Defensive evasion high |
| 5 | Attack to leg | Stand | Low-line strike |
```

**Corrected Step Table:**
```
| 4 | Cut above head | Void (step back) | High cut while retreating |
| 5 | Cut to leg | Stand or advance | Low-line follow-up |
```

**Current Practitioner Tip (Wrong):**
> "The high-low combination (void above head, attack leg) forces opponent to defend multiple lines simultaneously."

**Corrected Tip:**
> "The high-low combination works by cutting high while stepping back (voiding), then immediately attacking low. The retreat creates safety while the cuts maintain pressure."

---

### 2. Fifth Counter (Chapter 25)

Same corrections as First Counter—high-low with voiding footwork.

---

### 3. Sixteenth Counter (Session 3)

**Current Step 4 (Wrong):**
```
| 4 | Void above head | **Stand still** | High evasion |
```

**Corrected Step 4:**
```
| 4 | Cut above head | Void (step back) | High cut during retreat |
```

Note: "Standing still" may refer to a PAUSE, with void happening in subsequent step.

---

### 4. Dragon's Tail with Pendant (Session 4)

**Original Text:** "ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede"
→ "play a void quarter above his head"

**Correct Meaning:** Execute a quarter cut aimed above his head WHILE stepping backwards (voiding).

This creates the "wave" motion described—the sword arcs high during the retreat.

---

## Terminology Reference Table

| Original Term | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| "voiding back the right leg" | (with cut) | Pass right leg back | Retreat + attack simultaneously |
| "voiding back the left foot" | (with cut) | Pass left foot back | Retreat + attack simultaneously |
| "void back the same leg" | (with cut) | Same leg passes back again | Repeat retreat |
| "another void" | — | Pass a foot back | Additional retreat step |
| "void above his head" | Cut aimed high | Void (step back) | High cut during retreat |
| "void quarter above his head" | Quarter cut high | Void (step back) | Quarter delivered while retreating |
| "void at his leg" | Cut aimed low | Void (step back) | Low cut during retreat |

## Citations for Corrections

**George Silver (1599), *Paradoxes of Defence*:**
Silver uses similar terminology when describing yielding footwork—stepping backward while maintaining offensive pressure. The English principle of "quartering and voiding" (attacking while retreating) is central to Silver's defensive philosophy.

**Robert Kay (2020), HEMA Enthusiast:**
> "English void terminology refers to retreating footwork, similar to the German *weichen*. The void creates distance while the practitioner maintains offensive pressure."

**Brandon Heslop & Benjamin Bradak (2010), *Lessons on the English Longsword*:**
> "The void is fundamentally a passing step backward, creating distance while delivering a cut. This is the English approach to safe distance management."

## Summary of Changes Required

### Step Table Corrections:
1. **Move "Void" from Cut/Action column to Footwork column** where it describes retreating
2. **Remove "evasion" language** from Notes columns
3. **Clarify that cuts happen DURING the void** (e.g., "Quarter above head" + "Void (step back)")

### Practitioner Tips Corrections:
1. **Clarify void = footwork** throughout all explanations
2. **Fix high-low combination explanations** to show void is retreat, not evasion
3. **Remove any references to void as feint** or deceptive blade action

### Specific Sections:
1. **First Counter:** Major rewrite of step table and tips
2. **Fifth Counter:** Same corrections
3. **Sixteenth Counter:** Fix step table
4. **Dragon's Tail:** Clarify "void quarter" = quarter during retreat
5. **All "Spring during void" sections:** Clarify as "attack while retreating"

## COMPREHENSIVE ERROR INVENTORY

### Critical Step Table Errors (Void in Wrong Column)

| Location | Current Error | Correction Needed |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| First Counter (session2, main) | `Void above head \| Stand \| Defensive evasion high` | Move void to footwork, change notes |
| Fifth Counter (session2, main) | `Void above head \| **Stand still** \| High defensive evasion` | Same fix |
| Sixteenth Counter (session3, main) | `Void above head \| **Stand still** \| High evasion` | Same fix |
| Dragon's Tail (session4, special) | `Void quarter above head \| Stand` | Clarify as quarter during retreat |

### Practitioner Tips Errors

| File | Error Text | Issue |
|------|-----------|-------|
| session2/main | "High void forces reaction" | Implies void does something active |
| session2/main | "Void draws opponent forward" | Implies void is bait, not footwork |
| session2/main | "Mid-void baits their chase" | Same issue |
| session2/main | "void above head (defensive)" | Implies body evasion |
| session2/main | "high-low combination (void above head, attack leg)" | Implies void is blade action |

### Section Headers/Explanatory Text Errors

| File | Error | Correction |
|------|-------|------------|
| session4_final, main | "#### SPRING DURING VOID" | Rename to "#### ATTACKING WHILE RETREATING" |
| session4_final, main | "Spring during void = attacking while retreating" | Clarify void IS the retreat |
| session1, main | "Opponent commits → You void opposite (create opening)" | Clarify void = retreat, not counter-move |

### Correct Usages (DO NOT CHANGE)

These are correctly interpreted and should remain:
- `| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |` ✓
- "Void creates distance" ✓
- "attacking while retreating" ✓
- "voiding back the left leg" ✓
- "another void" = another passing step back ✓
