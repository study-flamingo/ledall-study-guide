## What Is This?

This repository contains a **complete enhanced study guide** for the Ledall Roll, one of only three surviving Medieval English longsword manuscripts. Unlike typical GitHub repositories, this is a **writing project** - scholarly documentation of a 500-year-old martial arts system.

### The Ledall Roll Manuscript

The Ledall Roll (British Library Additional MS 39564) is a vellum scroll from Tudor England containing **41 plays** (techniques) representing a sophisticated fighting system emphasizing:

- Displacement over binding
- One-handed spring techniques  
- Proffer (feint) strategies
- Multi-opponent tactics
- Conservative safety principles

This manuscript bridges Medieval English martial arts and Renaissance codification by George Silver.

## The English Longsword System

### How It Differs from German/Italian Systems

**German Longsword (Liechtenauer tradition):**
- Emphasis on *Fühlen* (feeling in the bind)
- Extended blade contact through *Winden* (winding)
- Multiple master-cuts (*Meisterhau*)

**Italian Longsword (Fiore, Vadi):**
- Guard-based system (*Poste*)
- Crossing and controlling techniques
- Emphasis on armored combat

**English Longsword (Ledall Roll):**
- **Displacement over binding** - quick cuts to remove threats
- **Springs** - one-handed extensions for maximum reach
- **Proffers** - baited openings and psychological warfare
- **Quarter-and-void** - attacking while retreating for safety
- **Practical focus** - survival over sport, including multi-opponent tactics

### Core Principles

- Distance management through voids and springs
- Initiative maintenance via continuous pressure
- Safety prioritization (conservative tactics)
- Psychological warfare (proffers, feints, deceptions)
- Simplicity and reliability over complexity

> ### About Bernard van Orley (c. 1487–1541)
>
> Van Orley was the leading Brussels court artist of his time, serving the Habsburg rulers Wikipedia, including Margaret of Austria (from 1515) and being appointed court painter in 1518 Encyclopedia Britannica. Though he never visited Italy, he was heavily influenced by Italian Renaissance painting, especially Raphael's tapestry cartoons Wikipedia that were in Brussels 1516-1520. Albrecht Dürer made a portrait of him in 1521 Encyclopedia Britannica, and the two likely discussed tapestry design while Dürer was van Orley's houseguest.
>
> About the Tapestries:
>
> This is one of seven enormous panels, each about 27 by 14 feet Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, making them truly monumental works. They were woven in Brussels by Willem and Jan Dermoyen in deeply saturated hues and exquisite detail, luxuriously highlighted with gold and silver thread Kimbell Art Museum. A single panel could take over a year to produce Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco.
>
> The tapestries were commissioned by the States General of the Low Countries as a gift to Emperor Charles V Narratives, presented to him in 1531—six years after the battle. They served as both propaganda celebrating Habsburg victory and as practical insulation for cold stone palaces. The preparatory cartoons (small-scale drawings) survive in the Louvre, Paris.
>
> Why They Matter for HEMA:
>
> These tapestries are remarkably detailed visual records of early 16th-century combat, showing life-size figures Wikipedia in full battle regalia. They depict the transition period when firearms (arquebuses) were beginning to dominate medieval-style armored cavalry—the French heavy cavalry, in full plate armor, were decisively defeated by more nimble imperial troops with firearms. The tapestries show specific arms, armor styles, and tactical formations contemporary to your longsword studies!
