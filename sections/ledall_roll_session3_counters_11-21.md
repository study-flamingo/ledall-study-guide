### CHAPTER 28: THE ELEVENTH COUNTER - "THE SHORT SPRING WITH 2 THRUSTS FOLLOWING"

**Original Text:** *The xjth callyde ye ſhort ſpryng wt ij foynes folowyng A profur A rake wt a quarter full An other voyde lyghtly pley a ſhort ſpryng voydyng bake the lyffte legge ſette handſ uppon the ſwerde ſettyng up a foyne by the lyffte ſhuldr bryng hyt forth be fore you ſete in yor lyffte legge wt a ſuche an other foyne att hys face folowyde wyth ye ryght legge lyghtly pley a quarter full wt an other voyde And be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a quarter full, another void. Lightly play a Short Spring, voiding back the left leg set hands upon the sword, setting up a thrust by the left shoulder. Bring it forth before you, set in your left leg with a such another thrust at his face. Followed with the right leg lightly play a Quarter full, with another void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Eleventh Counter introduces sophisticated hand positioning—'set hands upon the sword, setting up a thrust by the left shoulder.' This chamber position creates an unusual angle that's difficult to read and defend."[3]

> "The 'two thrusts following' refers to: first thrust chambered by left shoulder, second thrust to face. Both emerge from the same side, creating a doubling effect that overwhelms single-line defense."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Short spring** initiates sequence
- **Sophisticated hand positioning** ("by left shoulder")
- **Two thrusts** from same-side position
- Both thrusts target high line
- "Lithely" emphasizes speed throughout
- Complex coordination required

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Short spring probes/disrupts
- Shoulder-chamber position hides angle
- First thrust sets pattern
- Second thrust (face) exploits pattern expectation
- Speed prevents defensive adjustment

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | Void | Step back | Create space |
| 5 | Short spring | Void back left leg | Quick spring + retreat |
| 6 | Set hands on sword | Stand | Two-handed grip adjustment |
| 7 | Chamber thrust (by left shoulder) | Stand | Set up position |
| 8 | Bring forth before you | Stand | Preparatory extension |
| 9 | **First thrust** | Set in left leg | Advance + thrust |
| 10 | **Second thrust to face** | Follow with right leg | Advance + face thrust |
| 11 | Quarter (full) | Stand (lithely) | Quick safety cut |
| 12 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 13 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### "BY THE LEFT SHOULDER" TECHNIQUE

**Understanding the Chamber:**

**Physical Position:**
- Both hands on sword
- Sword positioned near/by left shoulder
- Point directed forward or slightly up
- Handle near left ear/shoulder
- Unusual chambered position

**Possible Variations:**

**Version A: Over Shoulder**
- Sword rests on left shoulder
- Point extends forward-upward
- Like shouldering rifle
- Thrust emerges from high-left

**Version B: Beside Shoulder**
- Sword parallel to left arm
- Handle at shoulder height
- Point forward
- Thrust emerges from left-center

**Version C: Behind Shoulder**
- Sword behind/beside body
- Point hidden
- Maximum concealment
- Thrust emerges unexpectedly

**Modern Interpretation:**
Select version that:
- Conceals intention best
- Generates most power
- Feels most natural
- Works consistently

#### THE TWO-THRUST SEQUENCE

**Why Two Thrusts Matter:**

**Pattern Creation:**

**First Thrust (Step 9):**
- From shoulder chamber
- Establishes angle
- Opponent registers direction
- Prepares specific defense

**Second Thrust to Face (Step 10):**
- Same-side origin
- Opponent expects same angle
- Actually different target (face)
- Defense is for wrong thrust

**Doubling Principle:**
- First action sets expectation
- Second action exploits expectation
- Opponent's mind can't adjust fast enough
- Physical defense trails mental processing

#### SHORT SPRING FUNCTION

**Opening the Sequence:**

**Why Short Spring First?**

**Probing:**
- Tests opponent's reaction
- Gauges distance
- Creates initial response

**Disruption:**
- Forces opponent to respond
- Breaks their rhythm
- Creates momentary chaos

**Setup:**
- While opponent processes spring
- You're already setting hands
- Chambering thrust
- Preparing real attack

**Void During Spring:**
- Spring + void back = safe probe
- No commitment
- Can retreat if needed
- Maintains safety

#### HAND POSITIONING DETAIL

**"Set Hands Upon the Sword":**

**This Phrase Indicates:**
- Deliberate grip adjustment
- Both hands repositioned
- Specific placement for technique
- Not default grip

**Execution:**

**From Previous Position:**
1. Hands in standard grip
2. Adjust for chamber position
3. May shift hand positions
4. Ensure solid two-handed control

**For Chamber:**
- Rear hand may move forward slightly
- Front hand may adjust angle
- Both hands work together
- Optimized for thrust delivery

**Purpose:**
Specific hand positioning generates power for thrusts from shoulder chamber.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Shoulder Chamber Position**
- Explore different chamber positions
- Find what conceals best
- Find what generates power
- Practice setting hands deliberately
- Select one version

**Week 2: Single Thrust from Chamber**
- Chamber by left shoulder
- Bring forth
- Execute single thrust
- Return to chamber
- Repeat 30 times

**Week 3: Double Thrust Sequence**
- First thrust from chamber
- Second thrust to face
- Quick succession
- No pause between
- Partner observes

**Week 4: Add Short Spring**
- Spring + void back left
- Transition to chamber
- Double thrust sequence
- Focus on smooth flow

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Opening (proffer-rake-quarter-void)
- Main sequence (spring-chamber-thrusts)
- Safety (quarter-void-stop)
- Complete Eleventh Counter

**Week 6+: Speed Emphasis**
- "Lithely" throughout
- Quick spring
- Quick chamber setup
- Quick thrusts
- Quick quarter
- Continuous motion

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Complicated chamber transition—keep simple
- Telegraphing chamber position—opponent sees it coming
- Slow transition spring→chamber—must be smooth
- Two thrusts too similar—second should differ (face target)
- Not advancing during thrusts—"set in" means step forward
- Heavy execution instead of "lithely"
- Pausing to remember chamber position
- Weak second thrust—face thrust must genuinely threaten

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent defends standard attacks well
- Need unusual angle
- Opponent reads your patterns
- Want to test high-line defense
- After establishing predictable thrusts

**Deception Value:**
Shoulder chamber creates uncertainty:
- Where will thrust emerge?
- What angle?
- What target?
- When will it come?

**Answer:** Opponent doesn't know until it's too late.

#### DOUBLE THRUST TARGETING

**Strategic Targeting:**

**Both High-Line:**
- First thrust: High (from chamber)
- Second thrust: Face (also high)
- Both threaten upper body
- Overwhelming high-line pressure

**Why Not High-Low?**
- This Counter emphasizes same-side doubling
- Both from left shoulder area
- Creates specific pattern
- Different tactical purpose than high-low Counters

**Alternative:** Could adapt to high-low, but traditional interpretation emphasizes same-side double threat.

#### "BRING IT FORTH BEFORE YOU"

**Understanding the Phrase:**

**"Bring It Forth":**
- Extend the sword
- Move from chamber to ready
- Preparatory motion
- Sets distance

**"Before You":**
- In front of your body
- Centered position
- Ready to thrust
- Optimal delivery position

**Tactical Moment:**
This is the setup for first thrust:
1. Chamber by shoulder
2. Bring forth
3. Set in left leg
4. Thrust

Step-by-step preparation allows precision.

#### PARTNER DRILL: "CHAMBER CONCEALMENT TEST"

**Setup:**
- Partner observes you
- You set chamber position
- Partner guesses thrust direction/target
- You execute thrusts

**Scoring:**
- Partner guesses correctly: They get point
- Partner guesses wrong: You get point
- Goal: Your points > Partner's points

**Success Criteria:**
If partner frequently guesses wrong:
- Your chamber conceals well
- Thrusts are unpredictable
- Technique is effective

If partner frequently guesses right:
- Chamber too obvious
- Adjust positioning
- Reduce telegraphing

### CHAPTER 29: THE TWELFTH COUNTER - "THE RABETT WITH A SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The xijth callyd ye Rabett wt a ſpryng A pfur a rake wt a full quartr lyghtly ſett in the lyffte legge wt a rabett ſtondyng ſtyll lyghtly pley a full ſpryng att hys legge wt a full quartr An other voyde be att youre Stoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter lithely set in the left leg with a Rabett, standing still lithely play a Full-spring at his leg with a full Quarter, another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Twelfth Counter pairs rabett (control) with spring to leg (attack low). The standing still position between them creates a momentary pause that hides the spring's initiation—opponent can't tell when it's coming."[3]

> "Both actions are performed 'lithely' (quickly), emphasizing speed over power. This Counter teaches that rapid execution can overcome superior strength through timing."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Rabett establishes blade control
- Standing still creates deceptive pause
- Full-spring targets leg (low-line)
- Both rabett and spring performed "lithely"
- Simple structure, effective execution
- Speed emphasized throughout

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Rabett controls opponent's blade
- Standing still masks spring preparation
- Leg target often undefended (hands/blade protect high)
- Quick execution prevents counter
- Standard safety ensures retreat

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lithely) | Quick advance + blade control |
| 5 | (Pause) | **Stand still** | Deceptive stillness |
| 6 | **Full-spring to leg** | Extended stance (lithely) | Quick one-handed attack low |
| 7 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Safety cut |
| 8 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 9 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Focus on explosive spring from standing still position—no telegraphing. Practice until partner cannot anticipate spring timing.

### CHAPTER 30: THE THIRTEENTH COUNTER - "THE PROFFER"

**Original Text:** *The xiijth callyd ye pfur A pfur a rake wt a full quartr lyghtly ſett In ye lyffte legge wt a rabett other els ſett in the ryght legge wt a full quartr and an other voyde and be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter lithely set in the left leg with a Rabett, otherwise set in the right leg with a full Quarter and another void and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Thirteenth Counter is explicitly named 'The Proffer'—emphasizing that the opening feint is the core teaching. This Counter has TWO options, teaching tactical decision-making based on opponent response."[3]

> "Version 1 (rabett) is for when opponent commits to your proffer. Version 2 (power quarter) is for when they hesitate. Reading their response and choosing correctly is the skill being taught."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Named for its opening** (The Proffer)
- **Two distinct options** (choose based on situation)
- Option 1: Close with rabett
- Option 2: Power strike then retreat
- Teaches decision-making
- Emphasizes proffer technique

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Proffer is the test
- Opponent's response determines your action
- If they bite (attack): Rabett (Option 1)
- If they hesitate: Power quarter then retreat (Option 2)
- Adaptive technique

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 1

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Proffer** | Stand | **Core technique - make it good** |
| **OPPONENT** | **Attacks proffer** | Advances | **They bite—use Version 1** |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lithely) | Close distance + control |
| 5 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 2

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Proffer** | Stand | **Core technique** |
| **OPPONENT** | **Doesn't attack** | Stands/waits | **They hesitate—use Version 2** |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Probing action |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Setup |
| 4 | **Quarter (full)** | Set in right leg | **Power strike forward** |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Retreat |
| 6 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

**Training:** Practice reading opponent response. Partner randomly attacks or doesn't attack proffer. You must choose correct version based on their action.

### CHAPTER 31: THE FOURTEENTH COUNTER - "THE FULL-SPRING WITH A QUARTER"

**Original Text:** *The xiiijth callyde ye full ſpryng wt a quartr A profur a rake A full quartr lyghtly caſte owte a full ſhort ſpryng att hys face ſtondyng ſtyll wt a full quartr an other voyde be att youre ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, a full Quarter lithely cast out a Full short-spring at his face, standing still with a full Quarter, another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The apparent contradiction—'full short-spring'—likely means full commitment but short duration. Cast out explosively, spring to face quickly, return to guard immediately."[3]

**Key Points:**
- "Full short-spring" = explosive but compact
- "Cast out" = throwing motion
- Face target (high priority)
- Standing still after spring
- Two full quarters (safety)
- Similar to Second Counter

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Cast out suggests maximum explosive power
- Face target creates immediate threat
- Short duration = less commitment/exposure
- Double quarter ensures safety

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand (lithely) | Quick setup cut |
| 4 | **Cast out full short-spring to face** | Extended stance | Explosive throw-like motion |
| 5 | (Position) | **Stand still** | Static after explosion |
| 6 | Quarter (full) | Stand | First safety |
| 7 | Void | Step back | Second safety |
| 8 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Focus on explosive "cast out" motion—like throwing javelin. Spring should surprise with sudden violence then immediate control.

### CHAPTER 32: THE FIFTEENTH COUNTER - "THE SPRING AT THE LEG WITH 2 QUARTERS"

**Original Text:** *The xvth callyde ye ſpryng att ye legge wt ij quarters A pfur a Rake A full quarter lyghtly ſett In ye lyffte legge wt a ſpryng att hys legge then ſett in ye ryght legge wt a full quartr and an other voyde be att youre ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, a full Quarter lithely set in the left leg with a Spring at his leg, then set in the right leg with a full Quarter and another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fifteenth Counter demonstrates aggressive distance closing—two forward steps while maintaining continuous attack. Spring to leg on first step, power quarter on second step."[3]

**Key Points:**
- Aggressive two-step advance
- Spring targets leg (low-line)
- Two full quarters (name source)
- Continuous forward pressure
- Standard safety retreat

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Close distance rapidly
- Low attack (spring to leg)
- High attack (quarter)  
- Combined pressure
- Overwhelm defense

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand (lithely) | Quick setup |
| 4 | **Spring to leg** | Set in left leg | Advance + low attack |
| 5 | **Quarter (full)** | Set in right leg | Advance + power cut |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Two-step advance should feel like continuous forward motion. Spring-step-quarter-step as one flowing sequence.

---

### CHAPTER 33: THE SIXTEENTH COUNTER - "THE 3 QUARTERS"

**Original Text:** *The xvjth callyd ye iij quarterf A pfur A rake wt a full qurter ſtondyng ſtyll pley an other voyde A bove hys hede wt an other att hys legge then voyde bake ye ryght legge wt An other quartr and be att yor Stoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter, standing still play another void above his head with another at his leg, then void back the right leg with another Quarter and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Sixteenth Counter is the THIRD repetition of the high-low combination pattern (after First and Fifth Counters). This final reinforcement confirms: this pattern is fundamental, reliable, and worth mastering completely."[3]

**Key Points:**
- **Third "3 Quarters" Counter**
- Identical to First and Fifth Counters
- Final reinforcement of pattern
- Standing still emphasized
- High-low combination
- Standard ending

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Prove pattern's universal reliability
- Complete internalization through repetition
- Demonstrate confidence in basics
- "It still works every time"

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand still | First quarter |
| 4 | Void above head | **Stand still** | High evasion |
| 5 | Attack to leg | **Stand still** | Low strike |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back right leg | Third quarter + retreat |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** By this point, pattern should be automatic. Focus on perfection, speed, and tactical application rather than learning mechanics.

---

### CHAPTER 34: THE SEVENTEENTH COUNTER - "THE DOUBLE SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The xvijth callyd ye Duble ſpryng A profur a rake a full qurter wt an other a voyde lyghtly caſte owte a full ſhorte ſpryng att hys face ſtandyng ſtyll when ye ſwerde comyth a bowte off yor hede ?????? hytt wt yor ryght hand att yor ryght shuldyr. then lyghtly ſmyte a full ſpryng wt a full quarter. an other a voyde be att youre ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, a Full Quarter, with another, a void. Lightly cast out a Full Short Spring at his face. Standing still when the sword comes about your head, [bring?] it with your right hand at your right shoulder, then lightly smite a Full-Spring with a full Quarter, another, a void. Be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Double Spring features two springs separated by a unique sword-control technique: catching the blade at your right shoulder as it circles. This creates two distinct attack angles from one setup."[3]

> "Text damage makes this challenging, but the core is clear: first spring to face, sword circles overhead, second spring (likely different angle), safety sequence."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Two springs** (hence "Double")
- First spring to face
- Circular sword motion between springs
- Right hand catches at right shoulder
- Second spring follows
- Text partially damaged

**Tactical Purpose:**
- First spring probes/attacks
- Circular motion resets position
- Second spring from different angle
- Double threat overwhelms single defense

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | First quarter |
| 4 | Another action | Stand | Likely another quarter |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Create space |
| 6 | **First spring to face** | Extended stance (lithely) | Cast out explosively |
| 7 | (Transition) | **Stand still** | Prepare for circle |
| 8 | Sword circles overhead | Stand | Right hand catches at right shoulder |
| 9 | **Second spring** | Extended stance (lithely) | Different angle |
| 10 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Safety cut |
| 11 | Another action | Stand | Likely void |
| 12 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 13 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Practice circular sword motion carefully. Find what feels natural and conceals second spring's direction. Text damage requires interpretation.

### CHAPTER 35: THE EIGHTEENTH COUNTER - "THE DOUBLE RABETTS"

**Original Text:** *The xviijth callyde ye Duble rabettſ. A profur a rake wt a full quartr lyghtly ſett in the lyffte legge wt a rabett Stondyng ſtyll lyghtly pley an other rabett wyth a full ſpryng att hys legge other els ſett in ye ryght legge wt a Down ryght ſtroke att hys hede and a full quartr an other A voyde and be att youre Stoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter, lightly set in the left leg with a Rabett. Standing still lightly play another Rabett with a Full-Spring at his leg. Otherwise, set in the right leg with a Down-right stroke at his head and a full Quarter, another, a void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "Two rabetts (hence 'Double Rabetts') establish complete blade control before low-line spring. This is maximum control → maximum attack. Version 2 offers high-line power option if opponent adjusts to expect low attack."[3]

**Key Points:**
- **Two rabetts** (Version 1)
- Both performed "lightly" (quickly)
- Spring to leg after control established
- **Alternative version** (power high strike)
- Tactical choice based on situation

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Version 1: Double control → low attack
- Version 2: High power → retreat
- Opponent can't defend both options

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 1

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Setup |
| 4 | **First rabett** | Set in left leg (lightly) | Advance + control |
| 5 | (Position) | **Stand still** | Stable platform |
| 6 | **Second rabett** | Stand (lightly) | Additional control |
| 7 | **Full-spring to leg** | Extended stance | Low attack |
| 8 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 2

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1-3 | [Same opening] | | Proffer-rake-quarter |
| 4 | **Downright to head** | Set in right leg | High power strike |
| 5 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Safety |
| 6 | Another action | Stand | Likely void |
| 7 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 8 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Practice reading which version to use. Partner guards high or low. You select appropriate version based on their guard.

### CHAPTER 36: THE NINETEENTH COUNTER - "THE CROSS RAKES WITH A QUARTER"

**Original Text:** *The xixth callyde ye cros Rakſ wt a qurtr A profur folowede wt as many cros Rakſ as ye wyll then ſodonly to hys elbowe ſmyte a full quarter wt an other voyde and be att yor stoppe*

**Modern English:** A proffer followed with as many rakes as you will, then suddenly smite a full quarter to his elbow, with another voiding and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "This Counter is unique—you choose how many cross-rakes to execute ('as many as ye wyll'). This teaches rhythm establishment then breaking: create pattern with rakes, shatter it with sudden quarter to elbow."[3]

> "The elbow target is strategic—joint attack. Hitting elbow disables arm, removes their sword control. Different from other Counters' typical targets."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Variable length** (your choice on rakes)
- Multiple cross-rakes establish rhythm
- "Suddenly" breaks rhythm
- **Elbow target** (joint attack)
- Full quarter emphasizes power
- Adaptive technique

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Rakes create pattern expectation
- Opponent settles into defending rakes
- Sudden quarter breaks expectation
- Elbow target disables rather than kills
- Practical self-defense emphasis

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2-X | **Cross-rakes** (multiple) | Stand or varying | **"As many as ye wyll"—your choice** |
| X+1 | **Quarter to elbow** | Stand | **Suddenly—break pattern** |
| X+2 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| X+3 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

**Training:** Vary number of rakes (3, 5, 7, 10). Train opponent can't predict when quarter comes. Sudden transition is key.

### CHAPTER 37: THE TWENTIETH COUNTER - "THE BROKEN QUARTER WITH A THRUST"

**Original Text:** *The xxth callyde ye brokyn qrtr wt a foyne A profur a Rake lyfftyng up yor ſwerde as ye wo???? ſodonly wt yor lyfft honde thruſte for the a foyne to hys ????? folloyde wt ye ???????????? then ſett in ye ryght legge wt a quarter an other after and be at youre Stoppe*

**Modern English:** A proffer, a rake lifting up your arms as if you were to smite a quarter, then suddenly thrust at his chest with your left hand, followed with the left foot. Then set in your right leg with a full quarter and another voiding, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The 'Broken Quarter'—feinting a quarter cut that becomes a thrust—is sophisticated deception. Opponent prepares for descending cut, receives horizontal thrust instead. Different defense required."[3]

> "Left-hand thrust is unusual and emphasizes one-handed control. This could be forward hand thrust or transfer to left hand—both interpretations work tactically."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **"Broken Quarter"** = feinted quarter → thrust
- Lift arms as if to quarter (deception)
- **Suddenly** thrust instead (surprise)
- Left-hand emphasis (unusual)
- Followed with left foot (coordination)
- Power quarter afterward (option 2)

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Opponent sees quarter preparation
- Prepares high defense (overhead guard)
- Thrust comes instead (center/chest)
- Wrong defense = opening
- Deceptive technique

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Lift arms (as if quarter) | Stand | **Fake preparation** |
| 4 | **Thrust to chest** | Follow with left foot | **Sudden—left hand** |
| 5 | Quarter (full) | Set in right leg | Power cut |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE BROKEN TECHNIQUE

**What "Broken" Means:**

Throughout the Ledall Roll, "broken" means:
- Feinted/incomplete action
- Started but not finished
- Becomes different action
- Deceptive intent

**Examples:**
- Broken thrust = feinted thrust
- Broken quarter = feinted quarter
- Broken rabett = started rabett that redirects

**In This Counter:**
- Begin quarter motion (lift arms)
- Opponent sees overhead cut coming
- Abort quarter mid-preparation
- Thrust instead
- Different threat entirely

#### LEFT-HAND THRUST INTERPRETATION

**Possible Meanings:**

**Interpretation 1: Forward Hand**
- Left hand = forward hand (standard grip)
- One-handed thrust with forward hand
- Rear hand releases
- Allows maximum extension

**Interpretation 2: Literal Left Hand**
- Transfer sword to left hand entirely
- Right hand releases
- Unusual but possible
- Creates unique angle

**Most Practical: Forward Hand**
- Consistent with other left-hand techniques
- More reliable in combat
- Easier to execute
- Natural progression from rake

#### FOLLOWED WITH THE LEFT FOOT

**Coordination:**

"Followed with left foot" means:
- Thrust with left hand
- Step with left foot
- Simultaneous action
- Coordinated extension

**Benefits:**
- Maximum reach
- Body weight behind thrust
- Committed attack
- Hard to evade

**Mechanics:**
1. Arms lift (fake quarter)
2. Left hand initiates thrust
3. Left foot steps simultaneously
4. Full extension
5. Right leg still back (can void if needed)

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Broken Quarter Mechanics**
- Practice lifting for quarter
- Stop mid-motion
- Redirect to thrust
- Partner observes deception

**Week 2: Left-Hand Thrust**
- One-handed thrust (forward hand)
- Build strength
- Maintain accuracy
- 30 repetitions daily

**Week 3: Coordination**
- Lift arms
- Thrust with left hand
- Step with left foot
- Simultaneous action

**Week 4: Full Integration**
- Opening (proffer-rake)
- Deception (lift for quarter)
- Attack (sudden thrust)
- Safety (quarter-void-stop)

**Week 5+: Partner Testing**
- Partner sees your lift
- Do they prepare for quarter?
- Does thrust catch them wrong-footed?
- Adjust deception as needed

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Obvious fake—lift must look like real quarter preparation
- Slow transition lift→thrust—must be sudden
- Weak thrust—must genuinely threaten
- Poor coordination (hand and foot not together)
- Forgetting "suddenly"—speed is essential
- Not committing to follow-up quarter
- Right leg advance too small—needs to cover ground

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent defends cuts well
- They always prepare overhead defense
- You want to exploit pattern recognition
- Need unexpected angle
- After establishing quarter pattern

**Psychological Warfare:**
Once they've seen broken quarter:
- Every time you lift arms, they wonder
- Is it real quarter or broken?
- Analysis paralysis
- Hesitation creates further openings

**Setup:**
- First use: Real quarters (establish pattern)
- Second use: Real quarters (confirm pattern)
- Third use: Broken quarter (exploit pattern)

#### BROKEN TECHNIQUE ACROSS MANUSCRIPT

**Other "Broken" Techniques:**
- Broken thrust (7th Chase, 21st Counter)
- Broken foin (First Flourish)
- Broken rabett (22nd Counter)

**Common Theme:**
English longsword emphasizes deception through:
- Feints
- False preparations
- Redirects
- Pattern breaking

**Modern Principle:**
"Make the opponent defend against what isn't coming while you attack with what is."

#### PARTNER DRILL: "BROKEN RECOGNITION"

**Setup:**
- You lift arms (preparing quarter)
- Partner must guess: Real or broken?
- Execute chosen option

**Scoring:**
- Real quarter, partner guards high: Successful defense (partner point)
- Real quarter, partner guards center: Failed defense (your point)
- Broken (thrust), partner guards high: Successful deception (your point)
- Broken (thrust), partner guards center: Failed deception (partner point)

**Goal:**
Partner should guess wrong ~50% of time. If they guess right more often, your fake needs improvement.

### CHAPTER 38: THE TWENTY-FIRST COUNTER - "THE BROKEN THRUST WITH A SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The xxith callyde ye ba?? ??????????? ye fpryng A profur a rake wt ye full quarter ???? ??? fett in yor lyffte legge wt ye lyffte honde bryng ?? ?????????? ye ???????? of youre hede as ye wyll ????????? rabett then standyng styll brek ye ????? rabett ?????? ?????????? ???????? fmyte a full fryng at hys legge wt a full ?????????? ??????? and be att yor stoppe*

**Modern English:** A proffer, a rake with a full quarter, then set in your left leg and with the left hand bring the sword over the top of your head. Void back and start to play a rabett, breaking the rabett to strike a full spring at his leg with a full quarter, and another quarter and a quarter void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Twenty-First Counter features advanced deception: breaking a rabett mid-execution. The manuscript is damaged but the core is clear—feint the rabett, spring to leg instead. This is layered deception: opponent sees rabett coming, prepares for it, rabett disappears, spring appears."[3]

> "This parallels the Twenty-Second Counter's rabett-break pattern but adds left-hand positioning and overhead sword placement. Multiple deceptive layers overwhelm opponent's decision-making."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Broken rabett** (feinted rabett)
- Left hand brings sword overhead
- Standing still before break
- Full spring to leg after break
- **Triple quarter safety** (maximum safety)
- Text heavily damaged (interpret carefully)

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Overhead position creates angle uncertainty
- Start rabett (opponent sees it)
- Break rabett (surprise redirect)
- Spring to leg (unexpected low attack)
- Triple quarters ensure complete safety

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Setup |
| 4 | (Position) | Set in left leg | Advance |
| 5 | Sword over head (left hand) | Stand | Left hand positions blade |
| 6 | (Movement) | Void back | Retreat |
| 7 | **Begin rabett** | Stand | Start the motion |
| 8 | **Break rabett** | Stand still | Abort/redirect |
| 9 | **Full spring to leg** | Extended stance | Explosive low attack |
| 10 | Quarter (full) | Stand | First safety |
| 11 | Another quarter | Stand | Second safety |
| 12 | Quarter void | Step back | Third safety + retreat |
| 13 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### BREAKING THE RABETT

**Advanced Deception:**

**Standard Rabett:**
1. See opponent's blade
2. Execute rabett (cut against blade)
3. Displace their blade
4. Follow with attack

**Broken Rabett:**
1. See opponent's blade
2. **Begin** rabett motion
3. Opponent sees rabett coming
4. They prepare for impact/displacement
5. **Abort** rabett mid-motion
6. Spring to leg instead
7. Their preparation was for wrong technique

**Why This Works:**
- Opponent's mind committed to "incoming rabett"
- Body prepared for blade contact
- Blade positioned for rabett defense
- Spring to leg is completely different threat
- Can't adjust in time

#### TRIPLE QUARTER SAFETY

**Maximum Safety Emphasis:**

Most Counters end with:
- One quarter + void

Some Counters end with:
- Two quarters + void

Twenty-First Counter ends with:
- **Three quarters** (one full, another, quarter-void)

**Why Triple?**
- Very committed attack (spring to leg)
- Extended position
- Maximum safety needed
- Overwhelming retreat prevents counter
- Ensures clean disengagement

**Modern Equivalent:**
Like covering retreat with suppressing fire—continuous threat during withdrawal.

#### LEFT-HAND OVERHEAD POSITIONING

**Technique Detail:**

"With the left hand bring ?? over the top of your head"

**Interpretation:**
- Left (forward) hand controls sword
- Bring sword overhead
- Creates high chamber position
- Similar to Third Counter's behind-shoulder
- Different angle, same principle

**Purpose:**
- Hides sword position
- Creates angle uncertainty
- Opponent can't judge attack direction
- Deceptive positioning

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Overhead Positioning**
- Left hand brings sword overhead
- Explore comfortable positions
- Find what conceals best
- Practice transition

**Week 2: Rabett Start-Stop**
- Begin rabett motion
- Stop mid-execution
- Redirect to different action
- Partner observes

**Week 3: Broken Rabett → Spring**
- Start rabett
- Break it
- Spring to leg
- Smooth transition
- No telegraphing

**Week 4: Add Triple Quarters**
- After spring
- Three quarters in succession
- Maintain form throughout
- Don't rush

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Opening sequence
- Overhead positioning
- Broken rabett
- Spring
- Triple quarter safety
- Complete Counter

**Week 6+: Damage Interpretation**
- Text is damaged
- Test different interpretations
- Document what works
- Share findings with community

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Obvious rabett fake—must look real initially
- Weak spring after complex setup—must threaten
- Only two quarters instead of three—text specifies three
- Rushing through triple quarters—maintain threat throughout
- Not voiding on final quarter—critical for safety
- Overhead position too complicated—keep simple
- Losing track of sequence (it's complex)

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent expects rabetts from you
- They've learned to defend rabetts
- Need to exploit their pattern recognition
- Want to demonstrate advanced skill
- Decisive moment (complex technique)

**Layered Deception:**
1. Overhead position (first layer—where will attack come from?)
2. Rabett start (second layer—they think they know)
3. Rabett break (third layer—they were wrong)
4. Spring to leg (fourth layer—completely different attack)
5. Triple quarters (overwhelming safety)

**Opponent Experience:**
"Overhead... ok I need to watch... rabett starting... I can counter this... wait where did it go... OW my leg... they're still attacking... still attacking... still attacking... ok they're done."

#### TEXT DAMAGE CONSIDERATIONS

**What We Know:**
- Proffer-rake-quarter opening (clear)
- Left hand overhead positioning (mostly clear)
- Void back (clear)
- Start rabett (clear)
- Break rabett (clear)
- Spring to leg (clear)
- Triple quarters (clear)

**What's Uncertain:**
- Exact overhead positioning details
- Specific void distance
- Exact rabett break mechanics

**Modern Approach:**
- Test multiple interpretations
- Use what works
- Document findings
- Share with community
- Acknowledge uncertainty
