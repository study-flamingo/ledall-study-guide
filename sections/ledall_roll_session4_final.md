### CHAPTER 39: THE TWENTY-THIRD COUNTER - "THE FACING, WITH THE SPRING"

**Original Text:** *The xxiijth callyde the facyng wt ye ſpryng A pfur a rake wt a full quartr ſett in ye lyffte legge wt a rabett then voyde bake ye ſame legge and ſmyte a full ſpryng att hys legge other els ſette in ye ryght legge wt a full quartr and an other voyde and be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter, set in the left leg with a Rabett, then void back the same leg and smite a Full-spring at his leg. Other else set in the right leg with a full Quarter and another void and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "'The Facing' likely means confronting or directly engaging the opponent—squaring up aggressively. The unusual footwork (advance left, void back same leg, spring while retreating) creates a dynamic in-out motion that's hard to track."[3]

> "This is the FINAL numbered Counter—the 23rd. It teaches same-leg advance-retreat, a sophisticated footwork pattern that maximizes safety while maintaining offensive threat. Two versions offer tactical flexibility."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Final numbered Counter** (23rd)
- "Facing" = confronting/engaging
- **Same-leg pattern** (left in, left back)
- Spring delivered **during retreat** (unusual)
- **Two versions** (tactical choice)
- Emphasizes dynamic movement

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Version 1: Control → retreat-attack → safety
- Version 2: Control → power strike → retreat
- Same-leg movement creates unpredictability
- Spring while voiding = attacking while retreating (the void IS the retreat)

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 1

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Setup |
| 4 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg | Advance + blade control |
| 5 | **Spring to leg** | Void back same leg (left) | **Retreat while attacking** |
| 6 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - VERSION 2

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1-3 | [Same opening] | | Proffer-rake-quarter |
| 4 | **Quarter (full)** | Set in right leg | Power strike + advance |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Retreat |
| 6 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE "FACING" CONCEPT

**What "Facing" Means:**

**Medieval English:**
- "Facing" = confronting
- Direct engagement
- Squaring up to opponent
- Aggressive intent

**In This Counter:**
- Not evasive
- Direct approach
- Rabett engages blade directly
- "In your face" attitude

**Tactical Philosophy:**
English longsword often emphasized:
- Safety
- Distance management
- Conservative tactics

"The Facing" teaches:
- Sometimes aggression is appropriate
- Direct confrontation
- Confidence in technique
- Balanced approach

#### SAME-LEG ADVANCE-RETREAT

**Sophisticated Footwork:**

**Standard Pattern:**
- Advance left leg
- Advance right leg
- Retreat right leg
- Retreat left leg

**This Counter:**
- Advance left leg (with rabett)
- **Retreat same leg** (left, with spring)
- No right leg movement

**Why This Works:**

**Speed:**
- Same leg moves twice (faster)
- No cross-body weight transfer
- Quick in-out motion

**Deception:**
- Unusual pattern
- Opponent tracks standard footwork
- This breaks pattern
- Creates hesitation

**Safety:**
- Advance (rabett) controlled
- Immediate retreat available
- No commitment to full advance
- Escape route built-in

#### ATTACKING WHILE RETREATING (SPRING WHILE VOIDING)

**The English Principle:**

This embodies the English principle: "Quarter and void"—attacking during retreat. The void IS the retreating footwork; the spring happens simultaneously.

**Mechanics:**
1. Rabett controls blade (step forward)
2. Begin void back (passing step backwards—weight shifts rear)
3. **During retreat** execute spring
4. Spring maintains offensive threat
5. Void (the retreat itself) creates safety
6. Simultaneous offense and defense

**Tactical Brilliance:**
- Opponent may pursue your rabett
- Your void makes them over-extend
- Your spring hits them mid-pursuit
- They can't adjust (committed forward)

**Training Focus:**
This is **advanced technique**—spring and void must be perfectly coordinated. Practice extensively before attempting at speed.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Same-Leg Pattern**
- Advance left
- Void back left
- No sword
- Just footwork
- 50 repetitions
- Build muscle memory

**Week 2: Add Rabett**
- Same footwork
- Add rabett on advance
- Feel blade control
- Smooth execution

**Week 3: Spring Timing**
- Spring while voiding
- Difficult coordination
- Start very slow
- Gradually increase speed
- Partner holds target

**Week 4: Version 1 Complete**
- Full sequence
- Opening → rabett → spring-void
- Focus on smoothness
- Test with partner

**Week 5: Version 2**
- Alternative ending
- Power quarter instead
- Simpler option
- Know when to use each

**Week 6+: Tactical Decision**
- Practice choosing version
- Read opponent's position
- Select appropriate response
- Build instinct

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Advancing right leg instead of repeating left—breaks pattern
- Pausing between advance and retreat—should be continuous
- Spring before void instead of during—timing is critical
- Weak spring (it must threaten despite retreating)
- Losing balance during same-leg pattern
- Not committing to rabett—must genuinely control
- Choosing wrong version for situation

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use Version 1:**
- Opponent likely to pursue
- You want spring to catch pursuit
- Need maximum safety
- Against aggressive fencers

**When to Use Version 2:**
- Opponent won't pursue
- Need power strike
- Simpler execution preferred
- Against hesitant fencers

**Psychological Impact:**
- "I'll engage directly" (facing)
- "But only on my terms" (same-leg retreat)
- "And I'm still attacking" (spring while retreating)
- Demonstrates complete control

#### THE FINAL COUNTER

**Twenty-Third Counter Significance:**

This is the **last numbered Counter** in the manuscript, marking completion of the Counter series.

**What It Teaches:**
- Advanced footwork (same-leg)
- Simultaneous offense-defense (spring-void)
- Tactical choice (two versions)
- Direct engagement ("facing")
- Sophistication through simplicity

**Fitting Conclusion:**
The 23rd Counter combines:
- Fundamental techniques (proffer, rake, quarter)
- Advanced footwork (same-leg pattern)
- Tactical flexibility (two versions)
- Core philosophy (attack while retreating)

**Complete Practitioner:**
By mastering all 23 Counters, the student understands:
- Reactive and proactive techniques
- Simple and complex patterns
- Power and speed applications
- Individual and combined techniques
- Conservative and aggressive tactics

#### PARTNER DRILL: "VERSION SELECTION"

**Setup:**
- Partner assumes position (aggressive or defensive)
- You execute Twenty-Third Counter
- Choose Version 1 or Version 2 based on their stance

**Assessment:**
- Aggressive stance → Version 1 (rabett-spring-void)
- Defensive stance → Version 2 (quarter-void)

**Success Criteria:**
- Correct version selection
- Effective execution
- Appropriate for situation

**Goal:**
Develop instinct for tactical decision-making under pressure.

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: COMPLETION OF THE SYSTEM

With the Twenty-Third Counter, the **Counter system is complete**. The manuscript has taught:

**Reactive Techniques:**
- Proffers (drawing attacks)
- Rakes (disrupting attacks)
- Voids (creating safety)
- Quarters (maintaining pressure)

**Offensive Techniques:**
- Springs (one-handed extensions)
- Rabetts (blade control)
- Downrights (power cuts)
- Thrusts (finishing strikes)

**Tactical Principles:**
- High-low combinations
- Same-side doubling
- Pattern-then-break
- Attack-while-retreating

**Complete Fighter:**
The student who masters all 23 Counters possesses comprehensive defensive arsenal applicable to any situation.

## PART IV: SPECIAL TECHNIQUES

The Ledall Roll concludes with two "Special Techniques"—distinct from Flourishes, Chases, and Counters. These are **situation-specific applications** that demonstrate the system's completeness.

**Characteristics:**
- Not numbered like Counters
- Not sequential like Chases
- Not solo forms like Flourishes
- Tactical responses to specific situations

**Purpose:**
- Complete the curriculum
- Address specific scenarios
- Demonstrate system adaptability
- Provide finishing touches

### CHAPTER 40: THE STOPPING RABETT

**Original Text:** *The ſtoppyng Rabett alfo ſtandyng att yor defence yff you bepayste youre Enmy when he begynyth to play A profur lyghtly ſett in yor lyffte legge wt a Rabett voydyng Bake voydyng bake the fame legge be at your ſtopp. Other els when yor Emny playethe A pfur wt a Rake and be gynyth to pluke bake hys ſwerde to ſete a quartr lyghtly ſette in your lyffte legge wyth ye ſayde Rabett then voyde bake the ſame legge and be att youre ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** Also, standing at your defence, if you bepayste (deceive) your Enemy: when he begins to play a Proffer, lightly set in your left leg with a Rabett, voiding back the same leg be at your stop. Otherwise, when your Enemy plays a Proffer and begins to pluck back his sword to set a Quarter lightly set in your left leg with the said Rabett, then void back the same leg and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Stopping Rabett is a **counter-to-Counter** technique—it interrupts your opponent's Counter execution. This teaches advanced tactical awareness: recognizing opponent's patterns and exploiting their timing."[3]

> "The key word is 'bepayste' (deceive)—you're baiting them into executing their Counter, then intercepting it mid-execution. This is meta-tactical fighting: countering their counter."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Reactive technique** (counter-Counter)
- "Stopping" = interrupts opponent's action
- Two scenarios provided
- Same-leg advance-retreat (like 23rd Counter)
- Timing is everything
- "Bepayste" = deceive/bait

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Opponent executes proffer
- You recognize it (from your training)
- Interrupt their Counter sequence
- "Stop" their technique
- Turns tables on them

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - SCENARIO 1

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **YOU** | Standing at defense | Stand | Defensive posture |
| **OPPONENT** | **Begins proffer** | Stand | **You recognize this!** |
| 1 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lightly) | **Interrupt—quick!** |
| 2 | (Retreat) | Void back same leg | Safety |
| 3 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### STEP BREAKDOWN - SCENARIO 2

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **YOU** | Standing at defense | Stand | Defensive posture |
| **OPPONENT** | **Proffer + Rake** | Varying | Counter sequence starting |
| **OPPONENT** | **Pulls back for quarter** | Stand | **Opening appears here!** |
| 1 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lightly) | **Catch them mid-preparation** |
| 2 | (Retreat) | Void back same leg | Safety |
| 3 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### THE "STOPPING" PRINCIPLE

**What Makes It "Stopping":**

**Standard Rabett:**
- Defensive/offensive technique
- Controls opponent's blade
- Sets up follow-up

**Stopping Rabett:**
- **Interrupts** opponent's technique
- Catches them mid-action
- Stops their Counter sequence
- No follow-up needed (they're stopped)

**Key Difference:**
- Standard rabett: Part of your sequence
- Stopping rabett: Ends their sequence

#### "BEPAYSTE" - DECEPTION

**Understanding the Term:**

**"Bepayste"** (Middle English):
- Deceive
- Trick
- Bait
- Lure into trap

**In This Context:**
You **deliberately appear vulnerable**:
- Stand at defense (passive-looking)
- Opponent thinks "easy target"
- They execute proffer (from their Counter training)
- You recognize what they're doing
- You interrupt with stopping rabett
- They're "bepaysted" (deceived)

**Meta-Game:**
- You know the Counters
- They know the Counters
- You know they'll use Counters
- You prepare counter-to-Counter
- Advanced tactical thinking

#### TIMING - THE CRITICAL ELEMENT

**When to Execute:**

**Scenario 1 Timing:**
- Opponent **begins** proffer
- Not fully committed
- Early in their sequence
- Strike while they're setting up

**Scenario 2 Timing:**
- Opponent has done proffer + rake
- Now pulling back for quarter
- **Between actions** (transition moment)
- They're vulnerable during transition

**Why Timing Matters:**
- Too early: They haven't committed, can adjust
- Too late: They've completed action, your advantage gone
- Perfect timing: Catches them mid-action, can't defend

**Training:**
This requires **extensive partner practice**. Must develop feel for opponent's rhythm and transitions.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Recognition**
- Partner executes Counters
- You observe
- Identify proffers
- Identify transitions (proffer→rake→pull back)
- No response yet, just observation

**Week 2: Timing Practice**
- Partner executes Counters slowly
- You identify window (when to stop)
- Call out "NOW!" when window appears
- Build recognition speed

**Week 3: Add Rabett**
- Partner executes Counters slow
- You execute stopping rabett at correct moment
- Partner freezes
- Assess: Was timing correct?

**Week 4: Increase Speed**
- Partner executes Counters normal speed
- You attempt stopping rabett
- Difficult—timing is tight
- Many failures expected
- Gradual improvement

**Week 5: Same-Leg Void**
- Add void back same leg
- Complete stopping rabett
- Emphasis on safety
- Don't overcommit

**Week 6+: Free Practice**
- Partner uses Counters randomly
- You must recognize and stop
- Build instinct
- Real-time decision making

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Not recognizing opponent's proffer—requires Counter knowledge
- Too early (they haven't committed)
- Too late (they've completed action)
- Weak rabett that doesn't actually stop them
- Not voiding back—overcommitted position
- Forgetting same-leg pattern
- Attempting without sufficient partner practice

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent knows Counters
- They're executing Counter against you
- You recognize their pattern
- Perfect timing window appears
- Confidence in recognition

**Prerequisites:**
- **Must know all Counters yourself**
- Must recognize them in real-time
- Must have excellent timing
- Must be willing to take risk

**Risk:**
- If you misjudge, you're exposed
- If timing is wrong, your rabett fails
- Advanced technique with failure cost

**Reward:**
- Turn their Counter against them
- Psychological impact enormous
- "You can't Counter me, I'll stop it"
- Dominance demonstrated

#### THE META-TACTICAL LEVEL

**Layers of Combat:**

**Level 1:** Basic techniques (cuts, thrusts)  
**Level 2:** Combinations (Chases)  
**Level 3:** Tactical responses (Counters)  
**Level 4:** Counter-to-Counter (Stopping Rabett)

**The Stopping Rabett represents Level 4**—advanced tactical thinking that requires:
- Complete system knowledge
- Pattern recognition
- Timing precision
- Risk assessment
- Instant decision-making

**Medieval Combat Theory:**
This demonstrates sophisticated martial philosophy:
- Not just physical techniques
- Mental combat
- Reading opponent
- Exploiting knowledge
- Chess-like thinking

#### PARTNER DRILL: "COUNTER RECOGNITION"

**Setup:**
- Partner randomly selects Counter
- Executes it on you
- You must identify which Counter
- Execute stopping rabett at correct moment

**Scoring:**
- Correct identification + correct timing: 3 points
- Correct identification + wrong timing: 1 point
- Wrong identification: 0 points
- Failed stopping rabett: -1 point

**Goal:**
Develop instant recognition and precise timing under pressure.

### CHAPTER 41: THE DRAGON'S TAIL WITH THE PENDANT

**Original Text:** *The dragonys tayle wt the pendante A profor wt a Rake ſtondyng ſtyll wt your ryght honde ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede and as the ſwerde wavyth a bowte. Our your hede ſett in youre lyffte fote then lyghtly, wyth the Ryght honde and foote throſte forth A foyne at hys face and throſte a bowe foyne att hys bely then ſmyte a full quatr And an other voyde And be att youre Stoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, with a Rake, standing still with your right hand play a void quarter above his head, and as the sword waves about, over your head, set in your left foot. Then lightly, with the right hand and foot, thrust forth a thrust at his face, and thrust a Bow-thrust at his belly. Then smite a full Quarter, and another void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Dragon's Tail combines circular overhead motion with high-low thrust sequence. The 'pendant' position is the guard you transition through—sword hanging/suspended during the circular movement."[3]

> "This is the FINAL technique in the manuscript—fitting that it combines multiple elements: circular motion (like Chases), one-handed technique (springs), high-low combination (Counters), and specialized thrust (bow-thrust). It's a synthesis of the entire system."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Final technique** in manuscript
- **Dragon's Tail** = circular overhead motion
- **Pendant** = hanging/suspended guard
- Right-hand emphasis (one-handed)
- Two thrusts: face then belly (high-low)
- **Bow-thrust** reappears (Fourth Chase callback)
- Synthesizes multiple system elements

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Circular motion creates momentum
- Momentum powers thrusts
- Pendant position hides intention
- High-low thrusts exploit defense
- Complete offensive sequence
- System culmination

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Opening |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt |
| 3 | Quarter above head | Void (step back), right hand | One-handed high cut while retreating |
| 4 | **Sword waves/circles overhead** | Stand | **Dragon's Tail motion** |
| 5 | (Transition) | Set in left foot | Advance during circle |
| 6 | **Thrust to face** | Right hand and foot | **Lightly—one-handed thrust** |
| 7 | **Bow-thrust to belly** | Stand or adjust | Specialized thrust low |
| 8 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Safety cut |
| 9 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 10 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE DRAGON'S TAIL MOTION

**Understanding the Technique:**

**"Dragon's Tail":**
- Sword describes circular/sinuous motion
- Like dragon's tail sweeping
- Overhead path
- Creates momentum
- Mesmerizing/distracting

**Physical Execution:**

**With Right Hand:**
1. Void quarter above head (one-handed)
2. Continue motion into circle
3. Sword "waves about" overhead
4. Full circular path (360°?)
5. Builds rotational momentum
6. Transitions to pendant

**Purpose:**
- Creates opening (opponent tracks motion)
- Builds power (circular momentum)
- Hides intention (which way will attack come?)
- Sets up thrust sequence

#### THE PENDANT POSITION

**What "Pendant" Means:**

**Pendant:**
- Hanging
- Suspended
- Dangling
- Point down or relaxed

**In This Technique:**
- Transition guard during Dragon's Tail
- Sword hangs/suspends momentarily
- Between overhead circle and thrusts
- Loading position for explosive thrusts

**Possible Position:**
- Point low/behind
- Hands relaxed
- Momentary suspension
- Spring-loaded for thrust

**Compare:**
- Tenth Counter uses pendant guard
- Second Flourish references Dragon's Tail
- Familiar elements combined new way

#### TWO-THRUST SEQUENCE

**High-Low Combination:**

**Thrust to Face (Step 6):**
- Right hand (one-handed)
- Right foot coordinates
- "Lightly" = quick, not heavy
- High-line attack
- First threat

**Bow-Thrust to Belly (Step 7):**
- Same right hand
- Different target (low)
- "Bow" technique (Fourth Chase)
- Second threat
- Exploits face defense

**Why This Works:**
- Face thrust forces high guard
- Belly immediately exposed
- Bow-thrust catches opening
- Defender can't protect both

#### THE BOW-THRUST RETURNS

**Callback to Fourth Chase:**

The **Bow-thrust** appeared in Fourth Chase ("The Bow-Thrust"):
- Specialized thrust technique
- Exact meaning debated
- Possibly half-sword
- Possibly arcing thrust
- Possibly two-stage thrust

**In Final Technique:**
- Reappears as finishing move
- To belly specifically
- After face thrust
- Low-line application

**Interpretation Consistency:**
Whatever interpretation you chose for Fourth Chase, apply same here:
- Half-sword to belly: Close-range power
- Arcing thrust: Curves around guard
- Two-stage: Initial probe, then commitment

**System Coherence:**
Technique introduced early (Fourth Chase) returns at end—demonstrates complete, coherent system.

#### ONE-HANDED EMPHASIS

**Right-Hand Technique:**

**Explicitly States:**
- "With your right hand"
- Void quarter (right hand)
- Dragon's Tail (right hand)
- Thrust to face (right hand)
- Bow-thrust (right hand)

**Why Right Hand?**

**Mechanical:**
- Rear hand has more power
- Circular motion easier with rear hand
- One-handed frees forward hand
- Maximum reach with pommel grip

**Tactical:**
- Unexpected (most techniques two-handed)
- Conceals intention
- Different power dynamic
- Demonstrates complete control

**Training:**
Build right-hand strength specifically:
- One-handed cuts (right)
- One-handed thrusts (right)
- Circular motions (right)
- Endurance work

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Dragon's Tail Motion**
- Right hand only
- Circular overhead motion
- Find smooth path
- Build momentum
- No thrusts yet

**Week 2: Pendant Transition**
- Circle overhead
- Transition to pendant
- Feel suspension moment
- Prepare for thrust
- Still no actual thrusts

**Week 3: Single Thrust**
- Complete Dragon's Tail
- Pendant transition
- One thrust (to face)
- Right hand and foot
- 30 repetitions

**Week 4: Add Bow-Thrust**
- Face thrust
- Immediate bow-thrust to belly
- Different targets, quick succession
- Partner holds targets
- Accuracy focus

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Opening (proffer-rake)
- Dragon's Tail sequence
- Two thrusts
- Safety (quarter-void-stop)
- Complete final technique

**Week 6+: Synthesis**
- Review how this combines:
  - Circular motion (Chases)
  - One-handed (Springs)
  - High-low (Counters)
  - Specialized thrust (Bow-thrust)
- Appreciate complete system

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Two-handed Dragon's Tail—must be one-handed (right)
- Weak circular motion—needs momentum
- No actual pendant transition—must pause/suspend
- Face thrust too heavy—should be "lightly"
- Bow-thrust unclear—apply Fourth Chase interpretation
- Not coordinating right hand and foot (step 6)
- Forgetting this is culmination—treat it with respect

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent expects standard techniques
- Need to demonstrate complete mastery
- Want to showcase system knowledge
- Decisive moment (it's complex)
- As finishing technique (literally final in manuscript)

**Psychological Impact:**
- Circular motion mesmerizes
- One-handed demonstrates confidence
- Multiple thrusts overwhelm
- Opponent realizes: "They know the entire system"

**Practical Concerns:**
- Complex technique
- Many moving parts
- Higher failure risk
- Use when confident
- Practice extensively first

#### THE FINAL TECHNIQUE SIGNIFICANCE

**Why End Here?**

**Synthesis:**
Dragon's Tail with Pendant combines:
1. Circular motion (Flourishes and Chases teach this)
2. One-handed technique (Springs throughout)
3. High-low combination (Counters emphasize this)
4. Specialized techniques (Bow-thrust from Fourth Chase)
5. Proffer-rake opening (Counter pattern)
6. Quarter-void ending (Safety principle)

**Complete Martial Artist:**
Student who has learned from First Flourish through Dragon's Tail can:
- Execute solo forms
- Perform partner drills
- Apply tactical Counters
- Combine techniques creatively
- Fight one or multiple opponents
- Attack and defend high and low
- Use one or two hands
- Move in all directions
- Stop opponent's techniques

**System Completeness:**
The Ledall Roll is **not random collection** of techniques—it's **complete curriculum** that builds from basics (Flourishes) through combinations (Chases) to tactics (Counters) to special applications (Stopping Rabett, Dragon's Tail).

#### GEORGE SILVER CONNECTION

**Historical Continuity:**

George Silver, writing 50-60 years after Ledall Roll (c. 1599), describes many same principles:
- True times and false times (timing)
- Making your space true (distance)
- Conservative safety (quarter-void)
- Simple effective techniques

**Dragon's Tail Specifically:**
While Silver doesn't use term "Dragon's Tail," he describes circular actions and guards similar to pendant position.

**English Tradition:**
The Ledall Roll → George Silver represents continuous English martial tradition spanning ~50-100+ years. Techniques evolve but principles remain.

#### FINAL PARTNER DRILL: "COMPLETE SEQUENCE"

**Setup:**
- Execute entire Dragon's Tail technique
- Partner observes and evaluates

**Evaluation Criteria:**
1. Circular motion smooth? (Yes/No)
2. Pendant transition clear? (Yes/No)
3. Face thrust accurate? (Yes/No)
4. Bow-thrust distinct from face thrust? (Yes/No)
5. Safety sequence complete? (Yes/No)

**Scoring:**
- 5/5: Mastery
- 4/5: Proficient
- 3/5: Adequate
- <3/5: Needs practice

**Goal:**
Consistent 5/5 before considering technique "complete."

#### CLOSING THOUGHTS
