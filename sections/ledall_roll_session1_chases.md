### CHAPTER 13: THE FIFTH CHASE - "AT THE ROUNDS"

**Original Text:** *The fyffte Chace callyd att ye rwondys To doble rowndys forwarde and ther folowes Contrarye all to yon man and yff you play hyt a gayne hyt wyll bryng you to yor grounde*

**Modern English:** Two Double Rounds forward and this follows contrary all to your man. And if you play it again it will bring you to your ground.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fifth Chase is explicitly a **partner drill**—'follows contrary all to your man' means you mirror or move opposite to your partner. This develops coordination, spatial awareness, and the ability to read opponent movement."[3]

> "The phrase 'contrary all' suggests complete mirroring—if your partner moves right, you move left; if they advance, you retreat. This creates a dynamic flow drill that builds reflexive response to movement."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Partner-dependent drill** (requires two fencers)
- "Contrary" = mirror/opposite movements
- Two double rounds = 4 circular motions total
- Traveling pattern (returns to start when repeated)
- Develops spatial awareness and coordination
- Foundation for contra-tempo tactics

**Tactical Purpose:**
This Chase teaches:
- Reading opponent's movement initiation
- Moving in opposition to create angles
- Maintaining distance while circling
- Coordination with training partner
- Foundation for contra-tempo (moving against opponent's rhythm)

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **BOTH FENCERS** | | | Perform simultaneously |
| 1 | First Double Round | Advance (Partner A) | Circular motion forward |
| 1 | First Double Round | Retreat (Partner B) | Circular motion backward (contrary) |
| 2 | Second Double Round | Continue advance (A) | Second circular motion |
| 2 | Second Double Round | Continue retreat (B) | Second circular motion (contrary) |
| 3 | Switch roles | Partners exchange | A retreats, B advances |
| 4-5 | Repeat sequence | Full repetition | Returns to starting positions |

#### PARTNER DRILL VARIATIONS

**Variation 1: Simple Mirror**
- Partner A moves right, Partner B moves left
- Partner A advances, Partner B retreats
- Maintain same distance throughout
- Focus on smooth mirroring

**Variation 2: Rotational Rounds**
- Both partners circle same direction
- Maintain constant distance
- Create circular footwork pattern
- Good for conditioning

**Variation 3: Contrary Rotation**
- Partner A circles clockwise
- Partner B circles counter-clockwise
- Paths cross and separate
- Develops complex spatial awareness

**Variation 4: With Blade Contact**
- Maintain blade contact throughout
- Perform rounds with contact
- Feel partner's pressure and movement
- Introduces *fühlen* (feeling) concept

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Basic Mirroring**
- Practice without swords
- Partner A leads, Partner B mirrors
- Focus on opposite movements
- Slow speed, clear signals

**Week 2: Add Circular Motions**
- Add sword movement
- Circular blade patterns during rounds
- Coordinate blade with footwork
- Increase to normal speed

**Week 3: Reverse Roles**
- Both partners should lead equally
- No predetermined leader
- React to whoever initiates
- Develops reflexive response

**Week 4: Unpredictable Rounds**
- Leader can change mid-sequence
- Follower must adapt instantly
- Tests attention and reaction speed
- Competitive element

**Week 5+: Advanced Applications**
- Add attacks during rounds
- Contrary movements become defensive
- Test in light sparring
- Develop tactical application

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Contra-Tempo Movement:**
The "contrary" concept is foundation for contra-tempo tactics:
- Opponent advances → You retreat (deny their attack)
- Opponent retreats → You advance (maintain pressure)
- Opponent circles right → You circle left (cut angle)
- Opponent commits → You void opposite (create opening)

**Distance Management:**
By moving contrary to opponent:
- Control engagement distance
- Never allow opponent to close unopposed
- Never retreat without purpose
- Maintain tactical initiative through movement

**Reading Intention:**
To move contrary, you must:
- Perceive opponent's weight shifts
- Anticipate their direction
- React before they complete movement
- Develop predictive awareness

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Moving at same time instead of opposite—breaks contrary pattern
- Losing distance control—should maintain constant separation
- Mechanical execution—should be fluid, responsive
- One partner dominating—both should lead/follow equally
- Not completing full rounds—pattern requires 4 full circles
- Forgetting to return to start—"bring you to your ground"
- Poor communication—partners should sync naturally

#### SOLO PRACTICE ALTERNATIVE

While designed for partners, can practice solo:

**Solo Drill:**
1. Visualize opponent position
2. Perform your two double rounds advancing
3. Visualize opponent retreating contrary
4. Reverse: perform retreating rounds
5. Visualize opponent advancing contrary

**Purpose:**
- Maintain muscle memory between partner sessions
- Develop visualization skills
- Practice circular footwork
- Condition for repeated rounds

#### GEORGE SILVER CONNECTION

Silver later wrote about the importance of footwork and distance:

> "He who controls the distance controls the fight. Learn to match your opponent step for step, but contrary to their intention."[7]

The Fifth Chase embodies this principle—moving contrary to opponent's intention prevents them from imposing their rhythm or distance.

#### CULTURAL CONTEXT: PARTNER DRILLS

The explicit partner-drill nature of this Chase is notable:

**Medieval Training:**
Most medieval sources describe solo forms or combat applications, rarely explicit partner drills. The Fifth Chase's clear partner requirement suggests:
- Formalized training methodology
- Master-student or peer training structure
- Recognition that some skills require partner practice
- Sophisticated pedagogical approach

**Modern Equivalent:**
Similar to modern:
- Fencing footwork drills
- Boxing mirror drills
- Martial arts flow drills
- Movement coordination exercises

### CHAPTER 14: THE SIXTH CHASE - "THE TUMBLING CHASE"

**Original Text:** *The sixte Chace callyd ye tublyng chace To doble rownds forewarde wt as many bakewarde all uppon the lyffte fote lythtly delyveryde/ then tumble forewarde rounde as a ball that ys to ſay wythe a Down ryght stroke ſete forewarde the ryghte fote bryngyng the ſword ov youre hede voyde bake the lyffte fote wt an other downe ryght stroke folowyde wt the ryght fote then bryng bake the fame fote wt a bake foyne Sete In the lyffte fote and ſmyte back a qurter.*

**Modern English:** Two Double Rounds forward, with as many backward; all upon the left foot lithely delivered. Then tumble forward as round as a ball: that is to say; with a Down-right stroke set forward the right foot, bringing the sword over your head void back the left foot, with another Down-right stroke followed with the right leg. Then bring back the same foot with a back-thrust, set in the left foot and smite back a quarter.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Tumbling Chase is the **most complex footwork drill** in the manuscript. 'All upon the left foot' means you're pivoting and spinning on your left foot while the sword describes circles—an advanced balance and coordination exercise."[3]

> "'Tumble forward as round as a ball' describes a rolling, continuous forward attack sequence—imagine a boulder rolling downhill. The momentum from the spinning should flow into the forward downright strokes."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Advanced technique** requiring balance and coordination
- "All upon left foot" = pivot/spin on left foot
- Four double rounds (8 total circles!) while standing on one foot
- "Tumble forward" = continuous rolling momentum
- Complex sequence: spin → roll → attack → retreat
- Builds conditioning and balance

**Physical Demands:**
- Significant balance challenge (8 rotations on one foot)
- Core strength for stability
- Hip mobility for pivoting
- Cardiovascular conditioning
- Momentum control

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **PHASE 1: THE SPINNING** | | | |
| 1 | First Double Round | Pivot on left foot (forward direction) | Right foot may lift or drag |
| 2 | Second Double Round | Continue pivot on left (forward) | Complete 2 full rotations forward |
| 3 | Third Double Round | Pivot on left foot (backward direction) | Reverse direction |
| 4 | Fourth Double Round | Continue pivot on left (backward) | Complete 2 full rotations backward |
| **PHASE 2: THE TUMBLE** | | | "Round as a ball"—continuous momentum |
| 5 | Downright stroke | Step forward right foot | First strike of rolling attack |
| 6 | Bring sword overhead | Stand | Preparatory arc |
| 7 | (Preparation) | Void back left foot | Retreat while loading next strike |
| 8 | Downright stroke | Follow with right leg | Second downright in sequence |
| **PHASE 3: RECOVERY** | | | |
| 9 | Back-thrust | Bring back right foot | Thrust while retreating |
| 10 | (Advance) | Set in left foot | Sudden advance forward |
| 11 | Quarter backward | Continuing retreat | Cut while moving away |

#### THE SPINNING PHASE: TECHNICAL DETAIL

**"All Upon the Left Foot":**

**Physical Position:**
- Weight entirely on left leg
- Right leg relaxed (lifted or trailing)
- Left knee slightly bent for stability
- Core engaged for balance
- Arms control sword momentum

**The Pivot:**
- Ball of left foot is pivot point
- Right leg swings to create momentum
- Sword circles overhead or to sides
- Hip rotation drives the motion
- Eyes track horizon (prevents dizziness)

**Forward vs. Backward Rounds:**
- **Forward:** Clockwise rotation (standard)
- **Backward:** Counter-clockwise rotation (reversal)
- Direction change tests balance and control
- Transition must be smooth

#### THE TUMBLE: "ROUND AS A BALL"

**What This Means:**
- Continuous, rolling forward movement
- No pause between strikes
- Momentum flows like rolling object
- Aggressive, unstoppable advance
- Like avalanche or boulder

**Execution:**
1. Spinning phase builds rotational energy
2. Energy transfers to forward movement
3. First downright uses momentum
4. Sword overhead maintains flow
5. Void back loads spring tension
6. Second downright releases energy

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Overwhelming attack sequence
- Opponent sees continuous motion
- Difficult to find opening to counter
- Psychological impact (looks unstoppable)

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Balance Foundation**
- Stand on left foot only (no sword)
- Hold for 30 seconds
- Gradually increase to 60 seconds
- Add gentle rocking motion
- Build ankle and core strength

**Week 2: Single Rotations**
- One rotation on left foot (with sword)
- Clockwise direction first
- Add counter-clockwise
- Focus on controlled pivot
- Do NOT attempt double rounds yet

**Week 3: Double Rounds (Separated)**
- Two forward rotations
- Rest
- Two backward rotations
- Rest
- Do NOT combine yet

**Week 4: Combined Spinning**
- Four double rounds in sequence
- No rest between
- Slow speed initially
- Gradually increase rotation speed

**Week 5: Add Tumble Sequence**
- After spinning, execute tumble
- Downright → overhead → void → downright
- Focus on momentum transfer
- May need to break down further

**Week 6+: Full Integration**
- Complete Sixth Chase start to finish
- Increase speed gradually
- Add intensity to tumble
- Test balance recovery

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Attempting full sequence too early—requires progressive training
- Using right foot for support—defeats "all upon left foot"
- Getting dizzy—keep eyes on horizon, not ground
- Rushing the spin—quality over speed
- Weak tumble—must commit to forward momentum
- Poor momentum transfer—spinning and tumbling should flow
- Not resting between practice attempts—this is exhausting
- Practicing when fatigued—injury risk is high

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use Spinning:**
- Create confusion about attack direction
- Build momentum for powerful strikes
- Demonstrate control and skill (intimidation)
- Practice balance and coordination
- Solo conditioning drill

**When to Use Tumble:**
- Overwhelm defensive opponent
- Create continuous pressure
- Push through hesitant guards
- Against opponent who waits for single attacks
- Final push when you have advantage

**When NOT to Use:**
- Against experienced opponents (telegraphed)
- When fatigued (control loss risk)
- On uneven terrain
- In actual combat (too risky)
- Early in bout (energy conservation)

#### CONDITIONING BENEFITS

The Sixth Chase is primarily a **conditioning drill**:

**Physical Development:**
- Balance (single-leg stability)
- Core strength (rotational control)
- Hip mobility (pivoting)
- Cardiovascular (continuous motion)
- Coordination (complex sequencing)
- Momentum control (tumbling)

**Mental Development:**
- Spatial awareness (rotation disorientation)
- Focus (maintaining form while dizzy)
- Discipline (completing difficult sequence)
- Confidence (mastering complex skill)

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: "TUMBLING"

The term "tumbling" in medieval England referred to:

**Acrobatic Skills:**
- Part of knightly training
- Display of physical prowess
- Entertainment at courts
- Demonstration of agility

**Martial Application:**
- Some techniques involved rolls or falls
- Agility valued in combat
- Physical fitness demonstration
- Part of complete martial education

The Sixth Chase may represent integration of acrobatic training with sword work—holistic physical development.

#### SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

**Important Warnings:**
- Clear adequate space (minimum 12-foot diameter)
- Remove obstacles and tripping hazards
- Practice on even, non-slippery surface
- Have spotter nearby initially
- Stop if dizziness becomes severe
- Do NOT practice when fatigued
- Warm up thoroughly before attempting
- Progress slowly—this can cause injury

**Signs to Stop:**
- Severe dizziness
- Loss of balance
- Ankle or knee pain
- Nausea
- Inability to focus eyes
- Feeling faint

### CHAPTER 15: THE SEVENTH CHASE

**Original Text:** *The sevyneth Chace A full stroke a for foyne folowed wt a quartr pleyng a brokyn foyne uppon the ryght ſyde an other on the lyffte ſyde thruſte forth a for foyne folowyde wt ij quarters wt the ſayde broken foynes playde on every ſyde thruſte forthe a for foyne at hys face voydyng bake wythe ij quarters*

**Modern English:** A Full-stroke, a For-thrust, followed with a Quarter. Playing a Broken-thrust upon the right side, another on the left side, thrust forth a For-thrust followed with 2 Quarters with the said Broken-thrusts played on every side, thrust forth a For-thrust at his face, voiding back with 2 Quarters.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Seventh Chase is a **thrust-oriented pattern** that teaches the broken-thrust (feinted thrust) on alternating sides. This develops the ability to threaten from multiple angles and creates openings through feints."[3]

> "Notice the structure: full-stroke → fore-thrust → quarter → broken thrusts alternating → fore-thrust → quarters → broken thrusts → fore-thrust to face → retreat. This is teaching a complete attack sequence from initial cut through final thrust."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Thrust-heavy pattern (6 thrusts total)
- **Broken thrusts** = feinted/partial thrusts
- Alternating sides (right, left, right, left)
- "Every side" = both sides covered
- Fore-thrust = straight thrust forward
- Ends with retreat (safety)
- Teaches attack sequence from start to finish

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Threatens multiple lines (high, low, right, left)
- Feints draw defensive reactions
- Creates openings for committed thrusts
- Final thrust to face is kill-shot
- Retreat ensures safety after committed attack

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **PHASE 1: OPENING** | | | |
| 1 | Full-stroke | Advance or stand | Opening cut, establishes measure |
| 2 | Fore-thrust | Extend | Direct thrust forward |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand or follow | Transitional cut |
| **PHASE 2: BROKEN THRUSTS (First Set)** | | | |
| 4 | Broken thrust (right) | Stand | Feinted thrust to right opening |
| 5 | Broken thrust (left) | Stand | Feinted thrust to left opening |
| 6 | Fore-thrust | Extend | Committed thrust after feints |
| 7 | Quarter | Stand | First safety cut |
| 8 | Quarter | Stand | Second safety cut |
| **PHASE 3: BROKEN THRUSTS (Second Set)** | | | "Played on every side" |
| 9 | Broken thrust (right) | Stand | Right feint again |
| 10 | Broken thrust (left) | Stand | Left feint again |
| **PHASE 4: FINALE** | | | |
| 11 | Fore-thrust to face | Extend fully | Committed kill-thrust |
| 12 | Quarter | Void back | Cut while retreating |
| 13 | Quarter | Continue void | Second cut, complete retreat |

#### BROKEN THRUST TECHNIQUE

**What is a "Broken Thrust"?**

The "broken" thrust appears throughout the Ledall Roll. Understanding it is crucial:

**Definition:**
- Thrust that begins but doesn't complete
- Feinted thrust
- Maintains blade contact or near-contact
- Creates reaction without commitment

**Execution:**
1. Initiate thrust motion
2. Opponent reacts (parry, void, or freeze)
3. Abort thrust mid-stroke
4. Redirect to different angle
5. Or commit to full thrust if opening appears

**German Equivalent:**
Similar to *Absetzen* (setting-aside thrust) or partial *Stich*

**Purpose:**
- Draw defensive reaction
- Identify opponent's defensive pattern
- Create opening for next attack
- Maintain initiative through feints

#### ALTERNATING SIDES PATTERN

**Right-Left-Right-Left Sequence:**

**Why Alternate?**
- Keeps opponent guessing
- Tests both sides of defense
- Creates rhythmic pattern that can be broken
- Develops ambidextrous threats

**Tactical Application:**
1. First broken thrust right → opponent guards right
2. Second broken thrust left → opponent shifts left
3. Opponent's head/center now exposed
4. Fore-thrust to center exploits opening

**Pattern Breaking:**
Once opponent expects alternation:
- Double to same side (right-right)
- Skip to fore-thrust early
- Add extra broken thrust
- Vary timing between thrusts

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Broken Thrusts in Isolation**
- Practice feinting thrusts
- Right side focus (10 reps)
- Left side focus (10 reps)
- Alternating (20 reps)
- No full sequence yet

**Week 2: Phase 1 (Steps 1-3)**
- Full-stroke → fore-thrust → quarter
- Repeat until smooth
- Focus on transitions
- Add broken thrusts next week

**Week 3: Phase 2 (Steps 4-8)**
- Add first broken thrust set
- Right → left → fore-thrust → 2 quarters
- Integrate with Phase 1
- Slow speed initially

**Week 4: Add Phase 3 (Steps 9-10)**
- Second broken thrust set
- Complete pattern except finale
- Focus on maintaining rhythm
- Don't rush

**Week 5: Complete Sequence**
- Add final fore-thrust to face
- Add retreating quarters
- Full Chase start to finish
- Increase speed gradually

**Week 6+: Partner Drill**
- Partner provides guards/wards
- Your broken thrusts test their defense
- Partner identifies which thrusts are broken
- Develop deceptive feints

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Opening Engagement:**
The Seventh Chase teaches how to open an engagement:

1. **Full-stroke:** Establish measure, test range
2. **Fore-thrust:** Probe defenses
3. **Quarter:** Transition to next phase
4. **Broken thrusts:** Identify defensive pattern
5. **Committed thrusts:** Exploit discovered opening
6. **Retreat:** Don't stay in measure after full commitment

**Against Defensive Fencers:**
Perfect for opponents who:
- Wait for your attack
- Defend passively
- Don't press initiative
- React to your actions

**Your Strategy:**
- Use broken thrusts to draw reactions
- Identify their defensive tendencies
- Exploit the pattern with committed thrust
- Retreat before they can counter

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Obvious broken thrusts—must look like real thrusts
- Not alternating sides—pattern requires it
- Weak fore-thrusts—these should fully threaten
- Pausing between actions—should flow continuously
- Forgetting retreating quarters—essential for safety
- All thrusts to same target—vary high/low/left/right
- Not committing to final thrust—it should threaten face
- Poor distance management—fore-thrusts require proper measure

#### FORE-THRUST VS. BROKEN THRUST

**Distinguishing the Two:**

**Fore-Thrust (For-Thrust):**
- Committed attack
- Full extension
- Real killing intent
- Follows through completely
- Used after broken thrusts create opening

**Broken Thrust:**
- Feinted attack
- Partial extension
- Drawing reaction
- Aborts mid-stroke
- Sets up fore-thrust

**In the Sequence:**
- Steps 2, 6, 11: Fore-thrusts (committed)
- Steps 4, 5, 9, 10: Broken thrusts (feints)
- Learn to distinguish by intention

#### PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSION

The Seventh Chase is **psychological warfare**:

**Creating Doubt:**
- Opponent can't tell real from fake thrusts
- Each broken thrust creates hesitation
- When will the real thrust come?
- Analysis paralysis sets in

**Pattern and Disruption:**
- Establish pattern (alternating broken thrusts)
- Opponent begins to expect pattern
- Break pattern with committed thrust
- Catches them off-guard

**Final Thrust:**
- Explicitly to face
- High-commitment target
- Opponent knows this is real
- Creates fear/hesitation in future encounters

### CHAPTER 16: THE NINTH CHASE - "THE FOUR POINTS"

**Original Text:** *The ixth Chace callyd ye four poyntf A Downe ryght stroke voydyng bake ye lyffte legge sodenly pley a rake folowede wyth ye ryght legge stondyng styll pley a quartr fayre be fore you then ſete In the lyffte legge and ſmyte bake a quartr.*

**Modern English:** A Down-right stroke voiding back the left leg, suddenly play a Rake followed with the right leg. Standing still play a Quarter fair before you, then set in the left leg and smite back a Quarter.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The 'Four Points' name likely refers to the four distinct actions: downright, rake, quarter, quarter. This Chase teaches economy of movement—four simple, efficient techniques in rapid succession."[3]

> "The word 'suddenly' is key—the transition from downright stroke to rake must be explosive. This teaches rapid changes between power strikes and quick harassment cuts."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Four distinct actions** (hence the name)
- "Suddenly" = explosive speed transition
- Retreat → advance → static → retreat pattern
- Simple but effective distance drill
- Rake follows power cut (tempo change)
- Final quarter delivered backward (retreat-attack)

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Power cut (downright) to open
- Quick rake disrupts opponent's recovery
- Static quarter pressures from neutral
- Backward quarter creates safe distance
- Teaches tempo variation (slow → fast)

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Downright stroke | Void back left leg | Power cut while retreating |
| 2 | Rake | Follow forward right leg | **Sudden** quick cut, advances |
| 3 | Quarter "fair before you" | Stand still | Static position, forward cut |
| 4 | (Advance) | Set in left leg | Step forward left |
| 5 | Quarter backward | Continuing movement | Cut while retreating |

#### THE "SUDDENLY" PRINCIPLE

**What "Suddenly" Means:**

**Tempo Change:**
- Downright = powerful, committed (slow)
- Rake = quick, harassing (fast)
- Transition = explosive (sudden)

**Execution:**
1. Downright completes
2. **Zero pause**
3. Rake initiates immediately
4. Opponent still processing downright
5. Rake catches them off-guard

**Training the Sudden:**
- Practice transitions specifically
- Downright → instant rake
- No windup on rake
- Explosive acceleration
- Like shifting gears in car (low → high instantly)

#### DISTANCE DYNAMICS

**The Pattern:**

| Action | Direction | Distance Change |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Downright + void back | Retreat | +2 feet away |
| Rake + forward right | Advance | -2 feet (return to start) |
| Quarter standing | Static | No change |
| Set in + quarter back | Retreat | +1-2 feet away |

**Net Result:**
- Return near starting position
- But opponent is off-balance
- Distance oscillation creates uncertainty
- You control the measure

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: The Sudden Transition**
- Drill: Downright → immediate rake
- 20 repetitions slow
- 20 repetitions medium speed
- 10 repetitions full speed
- Focus on explosion

**Week 2: Add Footwork**
- Void back with downright
- Forward with rake
- Coordinate blade and feet
- Smooth but sudden

**Week 3: Add Static Quarter**
- First three actions (downright, rake, quarter)
- Standing quarter requires balance recovery
- "Fair before you" = proper alignment
- No wobbling

**Week 4: Complete Sequence**
- Add set-in left leg
- Add backward quarter
- Full Four Points pattern
- Focus on flow

**Week 5+: Speed and Power**
- Increase commitment to downright
- Maximize sudden of rake
- Test with partner
- Partner pressure-tests your rake

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Recovery:**
Opponent's typical pattern:
1. You attack
2. They defend
3. They recover guard
4. They prepare counter

**Four Points disrupts:**
1. Downright (they defend)
2. Sudden rake (catches them during recovery - step 3)
3. Quarter (they're still processing)
4. Retreat quarter (you're gone before counter)

**Tempo Variation:**
- Power strikes create one rhythm
- Quick strikes create different rhythm
- Mixing them creates confusion
- Opponent can't settle into pattern

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Slow transition to rake—defeats "suddenly"
- Telegraphing rake—no windup allowed
- Heavy rake instead of quick—wrong technique
- Losing balance on static quarter—core weakness
- Weak backward quarter—must threaten while retreating
- Not actually voiding far enough—reduces safety
- All four actions same rhythm—must vary

#### COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: FOUR vs. FIVE vs. THREE POINTS

The manuscript includes Chases named:
- The Four Points (9th Chase)
- The Five Points (10th Chase)
- The 3 Points (11th Chase - version A)
- The 3 Points (12th Chase - version B)

**Pattern:**
- Named by number of actions
- Progressive complexity
- Similar opening (downright + void)
- Different emphasis

**Four Points Focus:**
- Sudden tempo change (rake)
- Distance oscillation
- Simplicity and efficiency

#### "FAIR BEFORE YOU" TECHNIQUE

**What This Means:**

The phrase "fair before you" appears in multiple Flourishes and Chases:

**Fair = Proper/Correct:**
- Straight ahead (not angled)
- Proper form
- Correct alignment
- Good technique

**Before You = Forward:**
- Directly forward
- Toward where you're facing
- Not to sides
- Center line

**Application:**
The static quarter should be:
- Delivered straight forward
- Proper form maintained
- No twisting or angling
- Clean, correct cut

#### SIMPLE EFFECTIVENESS

The Ninth Chase demonstrates that **simple doesn't mean ineffective**:

**Only Four Actions:**
- Downright
- Rake
- Quarter
- Quarter

**But Highly Effective:**
- Distance control
- Tempo variation
- Opponent disruption
- Safe retreat

**Principle:**
Master simple techniques executed perfectly rather than complex techniques executed poorly.

George Silver later wrote: "The simple fight is the shortest fight. He who uses unnecessary actions gives his enemy opportunity."[7]

The Four Points is simple by design—minimal actions, maximum effectiveness.

#### TRAINING DRILL VARIATION

**Partner Drill: "The Sudden Test"**

**Setup:**
- Partner holds sword in guard
- You execute Four Points
- Partner tries to counter during rake

**Success Criteria:**
- If partner can't counter rake → your "suddenly" works
- If partner counters rake → transition too slow

**Adjustment:**
- Increase explosiveness of transition
- Reduce any windup on rake
- True "sudden" prevents counter

**Goal:**
- Rake should be uncounterable
- Too fast for partner to respond
- Teaches real sudden execution

### CHAPTER 17: THE TENTH CHASE - "THE FIVE POINTS"

**Original Text:** *The xth Chace callyd ye fyve poyntf A Downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake the lyffte fote Sodenly pley a rake folowed wyth the ryght fote then voyde bake the lyffte legge wt an other Downe ryght ſtroke And pley a bake foyne voydyng bake the ryght legge ſtep In wt the lyffte legge and ſmyte bake a quartr*

**Modern English:** A Down-right stroke voiding back the left foot, suddenly play a Rake followed with the right foot. Then void back the left leg with another Down-right stroke and play a Back-thrust voiding back the right leg, step in with the left leg and smite back a Quarter.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Tenth Chase builds directly on the Ninth Chase (Four Points) by adding a fifth action. The pattern shows progressive complexity—master Four Points before attempting Five Points."[3]

> "The addition of the back-thrust (fifth point) adds defensive depth. Where Four Points advances and retreats, Five Points retreats twice, creating significant distance from an aggressive opponent."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Five distinct actions** (name source)
- Builds on Four Points pattern
- "Suddenly" appears again (explosive rake)
- **Two retreat sequences** (creates major distance)
- Back-thrust added as fifth element
- Complex footwork pattern
- More defensive than Four Points

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Extended retreat sequence
- Defense against persistent aggressor
- Back-thrust threatens during retreat
- Creates maximum safe distance
- Tests balance through multiple direction changes

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **SEQUENCE 1: (Like Four Points)** | | | |
| 1 | Downright stroke | Void back left foot | Power cut + retreat |
| 2 | Rake | Follow forward right foot | **Sudden** transition |
| **SEQUENCE 2: (Additional Retreat)** | | | |
| 3 | Downright stroke | Void back left leg | Second retreat + power cut |
| 4 | Back-thrust | Void back right leg | Thrust while continuing retreat |
| **SEQUENCE 3: (Counter-Advance)** | | | |
| 5 | (Advance) | Step in left leg | Sudden advance forward |
| 6 | Quarter backward | Continuing retreat | Cut while moving away |

#### PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY COMPARISON

**Fourth Chase (Four Points):**
1. Downright + void back left
2. Rake + forward right  
3. Quarter standing
4. Quarter backward

**Tenth Chase (Five Points):**
1. Downright + void back left
2. Rake + forward right
3. **Downright + void back left** ← NEW
4. **Back-thrust + void back right** ← NEW  
5. Set in left + quarter backward

**What Changed:**
- Static quarter removed
- Second retreat sequence added
- Back-thrust introduced
- More defensive orientation

#### THE DOUBLE RETREAT PATTERN

**Sequence Analysis:**

**First Retreat (Steps 1-2):**
- Downright + void left (retreat)
- Rake + forward right (advance back)
- Net: return to near start position

**Second Retreat (Steps 3-4):**
- Downright + void left (retreat again)
- Back-thrust + void right (continue retreat)
- Net: significant distance created

**Counter-Advance (Steps 5-6):**
- Set in left (sudden advance)
- Quarter backward (immediate retreat)
- Net: disrupts opponent's pursuit

**Total Distance:**
After complete sequence, you're 4-6 feet further from opponent than start, but you've attacked throughout.

#### BACK-THRUST DETAIL

**What is a "Back-Thrust"?**

The back-thrust appears in multiple Chases. Two interpretations:

**Interpretation 1: Rearward Thrust**
- Thrust delivered behind you
- Addresses threat from rear
- Less likely in single-combat context

**Interpretation 2: Retreating Thrust**
- Thrust delivered while moving backward
- Point threatens opponent as you retreat
- More likely meaning
- German *Zucken* (pulling) similar concept

**In This Chase:**
Given context (you're retreating from aggressor), most likely:
- Thrust forward at opponent
- **While** stepping backward (void right leg)
- Maintains threat during retreat
- Prevents opponent from pursuing safely

**Execution:**
1. Complete second downright stroke
2. Immediately extend thrust
3. Simultaneously step back right leg
4. Point remains directed at opponent
5. You're retreating but threatening

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Review Four Points**
- Master Four Points first
- Ensure "suddenly" is explosive
- Comfortable with opening sequence
- Solid foundation required

**Week 2: Add Second Retreat**
- Practice downright + void back left (again)
- Add back-thrust + void back right
- Focus on balance during consecutive retreats
- Slow speed initially

**Week 3: Integrate Sequences**
- First retreat (1-2)
- Second retreat (3-4)
- Connect smoothly
- No pause between

**Week 4: Add Counter-Advance**
- Set in left leg (sudden forward)
- Quarter backward (retreat)
- Complete Five Points
- Polish transitions

**Week 5+: Partner Pressure**
- Partner advances aggressively
- You execute Five Points
- Partner should NOT be able to close distance
- Test if back-thrust genuinely threatens

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Aggressive Opponents:**

**Opponent's Pattern:**
1. Charges forward
2. Pressures continuously  
3. Doesn't respect your retreats
4. Pursues relentlessly

**Five Points Response:**
1. First retreat seems like standard withdrawal
2. Opponent pursues (expects easy advance)
3. Second retreat surprises them
4. Back-thrust threatens during their advance
5. They hesitate
6. Your counter-advance disrupts their rhythm
7. Backward quarter ensures your safety

**Psychological Impact:**
- "I thought they were fleeing"
- "Now they're still attacking while retreating"
- "Wait, now they're advancing?"
- "Where did they go?" (backward quarter)
- Creates uncertainty and hesitation

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Not mastering Four Points first—foundation critical
- Slow rake transition—"suddenly" required
- Second downright weaker than first—both should threaten
- Back-thrust off-balance—difficult while retreating
- Not voiding far enough on retreats—defeats purpose
- Telegraphing counter-advance—should surprise
- Weak backward quarter—must maintain threat

#### BALANCE CHALLENGE

The Tenth Chase is a **balance test**:

**Direction Changes:**
1. Void back left (retreat)
2. Forward right (advance)
3. Void back left (retreat)
4. Void back right (retreat)
5. Step in left (advance)
6. Quarter backward (retreat)

**Six direction changes** in rapid succession!

**Training:**
- Core strength essential
- Hip mobility critical
- Ankle stability required
- Balance exercises supplement practice
- Progressive speed increase

#### DEFENSIVE PHILOSOPHY

The Five Points embodies **active defense**:

**Not Passive Retreat:**
- You're retreating (defensive)
- But attacking throughout (offensive)
- Opponent must respect your blade
- Can't pursue freely

**Creating Distance:**
- Sometimes best defense is space
- Five Points creates 4-6 feet quickly
- But you control the separation
- Not fleeing—tactical withdrawal

**Counter-Opportunity:**
- After creating distance (steps 1-4)
- Sudden advance (step 5) exploits hesitation
- Backward quarter ensures safety
- Repositioned for next exchange

George Silver wrote: "Distance is your armor. He who controls it is safe."[7]

The Tenth Chase teaches distance control through active retreat.

### CHAPTER 18: THE ELEVENTH CHASE - "THE 3 POINTS" (VERSION A)

**Original Text:** *The xjth Chace callyd ye iij poyntf A downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake ye lyffte fote ſodenly pley a Rake foloede wyth ye ryght legge then ſtandyng ſtyll caſte owte a full ſpryng at hys face wt a quartr and an other voyde*

**Modern English:** A Down-right stroke voiding back the left foot, suddenly play a Rake followed with the right leg then standing still cast out a Full-spring at his face with a Quarter and another void.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Eleventh Chase introduces 'cast out'—a throwing or launching motion. The full-spring is explicitly targeted to the face, making this a high-commitment, high-reward technique."[3]

> "Notice this is called 'The 3 Points' but has more than three actions. The 'points' likely refers to the three primary techniques: downright, rake, spring. The quarter and void are safety/recovery, not 'points' per se."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Opening identical to Four and Five Points
- "Cast out" suggests explosive spring
- **Full-spring to face** = high-line, committed attack
- Standing still for spring (stable platform)
- Quarter + void = safety sequence
- High risk, high reward technique

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Familiar opening lulls opponent
- Standing still appears defensive
- Explosive spring surprises
- Face target is killing blow
- Safety sequence ensures retreat

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Downright stroke | Void back left foot | Standard opening |
| 2 | Rake | Follow forward right leg | **Sudden** transition |
| 3 | (Preparation) | Stand still | Stable platform for spring |
| 4 | **"Cast out" full-spring** | Extended stance | **To face** - one-handed extension |
| 5 | Quarter | Stand or void | Safety cut |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |

#### "CAST OUT" TECHNIQUE

**What "Cast Out" Means:**

The phrase "cast out" suggests specific execution:

**Cast = Throw/Launch:**
- Explosive extension
- Like casting fishing line
- Like throwing javelin
- Sudden release of energy

**Applied to Spring:**
- Rear hand at pommel (standard spring)
- Body coiled initially
- **Explosive** extension
- Maximum reach instantly
- "Thrown" rather than "pushed"

**Comparison:**
- Normal spring: Smooth extension
- Cast out spring: Explosive launch

**Physics:**
- Uses elastic energy from standing still
- Hip drive powers extension
- Arm whips forward
- Sword "casts" toward target

#### FULL-SPRING TO FACE

**Why Face Target:**

**High-Line Attack:**
- Most guards protect center/low
- Face often less protected
- High-priority target (incapacitating)
- Psychological impact (eyes threatened)

**Risk-Reward:**
- **Risk:** High commitment, extended position
- **Reward:** Face hit often ends fight immediately

**Execution:**
1. Spring grip (hand at pommel)
2. Body stable (standing still)
3. Coil slightly
4. **Explosive** cast out
5. Full extension to face
6. Immediate recovery (quarter + void)

**Target Specifics:**
- Eyes (blinds opponent)
- Nose (painful, disorienting)
- Mouth (knocks out teeth)
- Throat (below face, but included)

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Cast Out Mechanics**
- Practice spring without casting
- Practice explosive motions without sword
- Combine: explosive spring
- Focus on "throw" feeling
- Wall target practice

**Week 2: Face Targeting**
- Partner holds target at face height
- Practice cast out to target
- Measure reach (how far can you extend?)
- Emphasize accuracy over power initially

**Week 3: Opening Sequence**
- Downright + void + rake
- Must be automatic
- Should require no thought
- Allows focus on spring

**Week 4: Integration**
- Full sequence: opening → spring → safety
- Slow speed initially
- Gradual speed increase
- Emphasis on standing still before spring

**Week 5+: Partner Drill**
- Partner advances aggressively
- You execute Eleventh Chase
- Spring must genuinely threaten face
- Partner evaluates threat level

#### THE "3 POINTS" NAME

**Why "3 Points"?**

**Theory 1: Three Primary Actions**
1. Downright stroke (first point)
2. Rake (second point)
3. Full-spring (third point)
- Quarter and void are recovery, not "points"

**Theory 2: Three Target Points**
1. Opening downright (general target)
2. Rake (hands/arms target)
3. Spring to face (specific high target)
- Three different targeting concepts

**Theory 3: Three Phases**
1. Opening (downright + rake)
2. Attack (spring)
3. Safety (quarter + void)

Most likely: **Theory 1** (three primary techniques)

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**

**Against Cautious Opponents:**
- They hang back, wait for your commitment
- Standard attacks don't reach them
- Spring extends your threat range
- Face target forces reaction

**After Establishing Pattern:**
- Opponent sees familiar opening (downright + rake)
- They expect Four Points or Five Points continuation
- Spring surprises them
- "This is different from what they've shown me"

**As Finishing Technique:**
- Opponent is tired, slowing down
- Their guards are dropping
- Face becomes exposed
- Cast out exploits fatigue

**Psychological Warfare:**
- Face threat is primal (eyes)
- Creates fear
- Opponent becomes protective of face
- Opens other targets in future

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak cast out—must be explosive
- Moving feet during spring—"standing still" required
- Spring to wrong target—specifically to face
- Poor recovery—quarter and void critical
- Not establishing stable platform—spring from unstable position fails
- Telegraphing spring—standing still should appear defensive
- Overextending without safety plan—must execute quarter + void

#### STANDING STILL PRINCIPLE

**Why Stand Still for Spring?**

**Stability:**
- Solid base for explosive motion
- Both feet planted
- Weight distributed
- Maximum power transfer

**Deception:**
- Standing still appears passive/defensive
- Opponent may relax slightly
- Spring from static position surprises
- Contrast with previous movement

**Energy Loading:**
- Like compressing spring
- Standing still = coiled
- Cast out = release
- Maximum explosive potential

**Compare:**
- Spring while moving = divided energy
- Spring while static = focused energy

#### PARTNER DRILL: "THE CAST TEST"

**Setup:**
- Partner at edge of normal reach
- Just beyond where normal thrust reaches
- You execute cast out spring

**Success Criteria:**
- Spring reaches their face
- Partner must react defensively
- If spring falls short, not explosive enough
- If spring reaches but weak, not committed enough

**Goal:**
Cast out spring should reach **12-24 inches beyond** normal reach. Anything less isn't a true "cast out."

### CHAPTER 19: THE TWELFTH CHASE - "THE 3 POINTS" (VERSION B)

**Original Text:** *The xijth Chace callyd ye iij poyntf A Downe ryght ſtroke voydyng bake the lyffte fote Sodenly pley a Rake folowede wt the ryght legge then ſtandyng ſtyll wt yor lyffte honde put yor ſwerde be hynde yor hede and throſte owte a fowle ſpryng at hys face wt a quartr and an other voyde*

**Modern English:** A Down-right stroke voiding back the left foot, suddenly play a Rake followed with the right leg then standing still with your left hand put your sword behind your head and thrust out a Full-spring at his face with a Quarter and another void.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Twelfth Chase is also called 'The 3 Points' but differs from the Eleventh by adding a specific guard transition: sword behind head with left hand. This creates an unusual angle for the spring—unpredictable and difficult to defend."[3]

> "Putting the sword behind your head with the left (forward) hand is biomechanically awkward, which is precisely the point—it hides the thrust angle and creates a deceptive position. The opponent can't judge where the spring will emerge."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Second "3 Points" variation
- Opening identical to 11th Chase
- **Sword behind head** = unique guard position
- Left hand (forward hand) controls sword
- "Thrust out" (not "cast out")
- Same target (face)
- Same safety sequence

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Opening establishes familiar pattern
- Sword behind head confuses opponent
- They can't see point position
- Spring emerges from unexpected angle
- Creates opening through deception

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Downright stroke | Void back left foot | Familiar opening |
| 2 | Rake | Follow forward right leg | **Sudden** transition |
| 3 | (Transition) | Stand still | Stable position |
| 4 | Sword behind head (left hand) | Stand | Unique guard |
| 5 | **Thrust out full-spring** | Extended stance | **To face** from behind head |
| 6 | Quarter | Stand or void | Safety cut |
| 7 | Void | Step back | Create distance |

#### SWORD BEHIND HEAD TECHNIQUE

**What This Means:**

**"With Your Left Hand":**
- Left hand = forward hand (standard grip)
- Right hand releases or guides lightly
- Left hand sole control (or primary control)
- Unusual one-handed position

**"Put Your Sword Behind Your Head":**
- Point goes behind/over head
- Handle in front of or beside head
- Creates reversed/inverted position
- Point hidden from opponent's view

**Possible Positions:**

**Position A: Over Shoulder**
- Sword rests on left shoulder
- Point behind head, angled down opponent's right
- Like carrying rifle
- Spring emerges from high right

**Position B: Behind Crown**
- Sword horizontal behind head
- Like headband or crown
- Point extended to left rear
- Spring emerges from unexpected left angle

**Position C: Pendant Behind**
- Point low behind back
- Handle high near head
- Inverted pendant guard
- Spring rises from low to high

#### DECEPTIVE POSITIONING

**Why Hide the Sword?**

**Opponent Can't See:**
- Point position
- Sword angle
- Attack direction
- Distance to weapon

**Opponent Must Guess:**
- Where will thrust emerge?
- High or low?
- Left or right?
- When will it come?

**Analysis Paralysis:**
- Too many variables
- Can't prepare specific defense
- Must react rather than preempt
- Slower reaction time

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Explore Positions**
- Try each position (A, B, C)
- Which feels most natural?
- Which hides point best?
- Which generates most power?
- Select ONE to master

**Week 2: Spring from Position**
- Practice spring from chosen position
- 20 reps slow
- 20 reps medium
- 10 reps explosive
- Measure reach and accuracy

**Week 3: Add Opening Sequence**
- Downright + void + rake
- Transition to behind-head position
- Must be smooth
- No fumbling

**Week 4: Full Integration**
- Complete Twelfth Chase
- Opening → guard → spring → safety
- Focus on deception
- Spring should surprise even yourself

**Week 5+: Partner Testing**
- Partner guards face
- You execute Twelfth Chase
- Can they determine spring angle before it comes?
- If yes, improve your concealment
- If no, technique is working

#### COMPARISON: 11TH VS 12TH CHASE

**Both Called "The 3 Points":**

**Similarities:**
- Same opening (downright + void + rake)
- Same target (face)
- Same safety (quarter + void)
- Same number of "points" (3 primary techniques)

**Differences:**

| Element | 11th Chase | 12th Chase |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Spring Type | "Cast out" | "Thrust out" |
| Execution | Explosive launch | Driving thrust |
| Guard | Standard spring | Sword behind head |
| Hand | Not specified | Explicitly left hand |
| Deception Level | Moderate | High |

**When to Use Each:**

**11th Chase (Cast Out):**
- Need maximum reach
- Target at distance
- Power/speed emphasized
- Straightforward attack

**12th Chase (Behind Head):**
- Need deception
- Opponent reads your attacks well
- Angle variation required
- Tactical complexity

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Pattern-Readers:**

Some opponents are very good at reading patterns:
- They see your preparation
- They anticipate your technique
- They counter before you finish

**Against Them:**
- 12th Chase hides preparation
- Behind-head position is unreadable
- Spring angle unpredictable
- Forces reaction, not anticipation

**Variation Strategy:**
Once opponent has seen both 11th and 12th Chases:
- They can't tell which you'll execute
- Same opening for both
- Standing still = could be either
- Must wait to see guard choice
- By then, too late to counter

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Complicated guard transition—keep it simple
- Spending too long behind head—should be momentary
- Weak spring from awkward position—must commit
- Telegraphing by looking where spring will go—eyes neutral
- Not selecting consistent guard position—master one version
- Forgetting left hand emphasis—right should release/guide only
- Poor safety execution—quarter + void essential

#### ONE-HANDED SPRING DEVELOPMENT

**Both 11th and 12th Chases emphasize springs:**

**Progressive Training:**
1. Master basic two-handed grip
2. Practice pommel-grip springs (right hand pommel)
3. Practice left-hand springs (forward hand only)
4. Practice from standard guards
5. Practice from unusual guards (behind head)

**Why Left Hand?**
- Forward hand (closer to opponent)
- Can extend further
- More deceptive (less common)
- Keeps right hand free (recovery)

**Building Strength:**
Left-hand springs require specific strength:
- Wrist strength
- Forearm endurance
- Shoulder stability
- Core support

**Supplementary Exercises:**
- Wrist curls
- Forearm rotations
- One-arm sword cuts (light weight)
- Progressive load increase

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: DECEPTIVE GUARDS

**Medieval Emphasis on Deception:**

Multiple medieval sources emphasize guards that:
- Hide intentions
- Conceal weapon
- Create uncertainty
- Force opponent to wait

**Examples:**
- German *Nebenhut* (side guard)
- Italian *Coda Lunga* (tail guard)
- English Dragon's Tail

**The Behind-Head Guard:**
Fits this tradition:
- Highly unusual
- Difficult to read
- Creates tactical advantage
- Forces opponent error

**George Silver:**
Later wrote about "false guards"—positions that appear one thing but enable another. The 12th Chase's behind-head position is a **false guard** in this sense.[7]

#### PARTNER DRILL: "GUESS THE ANGLE"

**Setup:**
1. You execute downright + rake + behind-head guard
2. Partner must guess: high/low and left/right (4 options)
3. You execute spring
4. Did they guess correctly?

**Scoring:**
- Partner correct guess: 1 point to them
- Partner incorrect: 1 point to you
- Goal: Your points > Partner's points

**Indicates:**
- More partner points = too predictable
- More your points = good deception

**Improvement:**
- Vary spring angles randomly
- Don't pattern yourself
- Make each unpredictable
