### CHAPTER 40: THE STOPPING RABETT

**Original Text:** *The ſtoppyng Rabett alfo ſtandyng att yor defence yff you bepayste youre Enmy when he begynyth to play A profur lyghtly ſett in yor lyffte legge wt a Rabett voydyng Bake voydyng bake the fame legge be at your ſtopp. Other els when yor Emny playethe A pfur wt a Rake and be gynyth to pluke bake hys ſwerde to ſete a quartr lyghtly ſette in your lyffte legge wyth ye ſayde Rabett then voyde bake the ſame legge and be att youre ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** Also, standing at your defence, if you bepayste (deceive) your Enemy: when he begins to play a Proffer, lightly set in your left leg with a Rabett, voiding back the same leg be at your stop. Otherwise, when your Enemy plays a Proffer and begins to pluck back his sword to set a Quarter lightly set in your left leg with the said Rabett, then void back the same leg and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Stopping Rabett is explicitly reactive—you're 'standing at your defence' waiting for opponent's action. This teaches patient timing: don't attack until you see their commitment, then interrupt."[3]

> "The phrase 'bepayste' (deceive) is key—you make them think they have initiative, but you're ready to stop their attack mid-execution. Psychological as much as technical."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Reactive technique** (not proactive)
- Standing at defense (waiting)
- "Bepayste" = deceive/trick opponent
- **Stopping** = interrupting their action
- Two tactical scenarios
- Same-leg advance-retreat pattern
- Timing is everything

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Patient defense
- Draw opponent's attack
- Interrupt during their preparation
- Fast in-and-out motion
- Minimal commitment
- Maximum safety

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

**SCENARIO 1: Opponent Begins Proffer**

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **SETUP** | Standing at defense | Stand | Waiting, observing |
| **OPPONENT** | Begins proffer | Initial movement | Shows intention |
| 1 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lightly) | **Interrupt their proffer** |
| 2 | (Recovery) | Void back left leg (same leg) | Quick retreat |
| 3 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

**SCENARIO 2: Opponent Proffers, Rakes, Pulls Back for Quarter**

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **SETUP** | Standing at defense | Stand | Waiting, observing |
| **OPPONENT** | Proffer + Rake | Movement | Executing opening |
| **OPPONENT** | Pulls sword back | Chambering | Preparing quarter |
| 1 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lightly) | **Interrupt the chamber** |
| 2 | (Recovery) | Void back left leg (same leg) | Quick retreat |
| 3 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defense |

#### THE REACTIVE MINDSET

**"Standing at Your Defence":**

Most techniques in the manuscript are proactive (you initiate). The Stopping Rabett is different:

**Patient Defense:**
- Don't rush to attack
- Wait for opponent's move
- Observe their pattern
- Identify opening
- Strike when they commit

**Why This Works:**
- Opponent thinks they have initiative
- They commit to their attack
- During commitment = vulnerable
- You interrupt = they can't recover
- Your timing defeats their technique

**Modern Application:**
- Counter-fighters use this approach
- Wait for opponent to attack
- Interrupt their preparation
- Works against aggressive opponents
- Frustrating for attacker

#### "BEPAYSTE" - THE DECEPTION

**Medieval English "Bepayste":**

**Meaning:**
- To deceive
- To trick
- To beguile
- To mislead

**How You Deceive:**
- Appear passive (standing at defense)
- Opponent thinks you're waiting/hesitant
- They believe they can attack safely
- They begin their attack
- You stop it = they were deceived

**Psychological Warfare:**
- Opponent's confidence shaken
- "I thought I had initiative"
- "How did they know I was attacking?"
- Creates hesitation
- Future attacks more tentative

#### TIMING: THE CRITICAL ELEMENT

**When to Execute Rabett:**

**Scenario 1: During Proffer**
- Opponent lifts sword (preparation)
- Opponent shifts weight (commitment)
- Opponent's eyes move to target (intention)
- **NOW** = execute rabett
- Before they complete proffer

**Scenario 2: During Chamber**
- Opponent proffers and rakes
- Opponent pulls sword back (chambering quarter)
- Sword at highest point (preparation)
- Hands furthest from you (extended)
- **NOW** = execute rabett
- During their chamber = most vulnerable

**Too Early:**
- They haven't committed
- They can adjust
- Rabett wastes energy

**Too Late:**
- Their attack already launched
- You're defending instead of interrupting
- Lost initiative

**Perfect Timing:**
- Between intention and execution
- They're committed but not launched
- Can't recover in time
- Your rabett stops them

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Recognition Drills**
- Partner practices proffers
- You observe WITHOUT acting
- Identify the exact moment to interrupt
- Don't execute yet—just recognize timing
- Build pattern recognition

**Week 2: Slow Execution**
- Partner proffers slowly
- You rabett at correct moment
- 50% speed initially
- Focus on timing, not power
- Build muscle memory

**Week 3: Scenario 2**
- Partner: proffer → rake → chamber
- You identify chamber moment
- Rabett during pull-back
- Slow speed still
- More complex timing

**Week 4: Speed Increase**
- 75% speed
- Partner varies their timing
- You must adapt
- Quick in, quick out
- Same-leg advance-retreat

**Week 5: Full Speed**
- Partner attacks at will
- You must react correctly
- Timing must be perfect
- Test under pressure
- Build instinctive response

**Week 6+: Unpredictable Scenarios**
- Partner mixes proffers, attacks, feints
- You only stop real attacks
- Don't react to feints
- Develop discrimination
- Real-combat preparation

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Acting too early—opponent can adjust
- Acting too late—defending instead of stopping
- Heavy rabett instead of "lightly"—wastes energy
- Not voiding back—staying in danger zone
- Both-leg retreat instead of same-leg—loses speed
- Forgetting to return to stop guard—left exposed
- Trying to do more—this is minimalist technique
- Impatience—this requires waiting/observing

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Aggressive Opponents:**

**Their Pattern:**
- Constant pressure
- Continuous attacks
- Overwhelming with activity
- Expect you to crumble

**Your Response:**
- Stand at defense (patient)
- Watch their pattern
- They begin attack (predictable)
- Stop it with rabett (interrupt)
- Void back (safety)
- Repeat

**Result:**
- Their aggression turned against them
- Every attack gets stopped
- They become hesitant
- Aggression diminishes
- You control pace

#### THE SAME-LEG PATTERN

**Why Same Leg:**

**Speed:**
- Left leg in
- Left leg back
- One leg = one motion
- Faster than two-leg sequence

**Deception:**
- Unusual pattern
- Opponent expects right follow-up
- You're already gone
- Can't counter effectively

**Safety:**
- Minimal commitment
- Quick recovery
- Reduces exposure time
- Maximum efficiency

**Training Challenge:**
- Requires balance
- Tests coordination
- Develops unique skill
- Worth the difficulty

#### PARTNER DRILL: "THE INTERRUPT GAME"

**Setup:**
- Partner announces: "I will attack in 5 seconds"
- Partner executes proffer or proffer-rake-chamber
- You must stop them with rabett
- Timing is scored

**Scoring:**
- Stop during their preparation: 3 points (perfect)
- Stop during their execution: 1 point (adequate)
- Stop after they complete: 0 points (too late)
- Stop before they begin: -1 point (too early)

**Goal:**
Consistent 3-point scores. This means:
- Perfect timing recognition
- Instant execution
- Correct distance judgment
- True "stopping" capability

**Variation:**
- Partner doesn't announce
- Attacks randomly
- You must always be ready
- Builds constant vigilance

#### MINIMALIST PHILOSOPHY

**Why This Technique Is Simple:**

**Actions:**
1. Observe
2. Rabett (one action)
3. Void (recovery)
4. Stop guard

**Four total steps**—one of simplest in manuscript

**Design Intention:**
- Reactive techniques must be simple
- No time for complex sequences
- Instant response required
- Simplicity = reliability

**Principle:**
Defense should be simpler than offense. Attacker plans, defender reacts. Complex reactions fail under pressure. Simple reactions save lives.

George Silver: "The true defense is quick and simple. He who decorates his defense dies decorated."[7]

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: COUNTER-TIME

**Medieval Fencing Theory:**

**Three Times:**
1. **Opponent's Time:** They attack, you defend
2. **Your Time:** You attack, they defend
3. **Counter-Time:** You attack during their preparation

**Stopping Rabett:**
Perfect example of counter-time:
- You don't wait for their attack
- You don't attack independently
- You attack during their attack's preparation
- Counter-time = highest sophistication

**Why Rare in Manuscripts:**
Most sources teach proactive techniques. Counter-time requires:
- High skill
- Perfect timing
- Tactical patience
- Psychological strength

**The Stopping Rabett:**
Teaches all these qualities.

### CHAPTER 41: THE DRAGON'S TAIL WITH THE PENDANT

**Original Text:** *The dragonys tayle wt the pendante A profor wt a Rake ſtondyng ſtyll wt your ryght honde ploy a voyde quartr a boue hys hede and as the ſwerde wavyth a bowte. Our your hede ſett in youre lyffte fote then lyghtly, wyth the Ryght honde and foote throſte forth A foyne at hys face and throſte a bowe foyne att hys bely then ſmyte a full quatr And an other voyde And be att youre Stoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, with a Rake, standing still with your right hand play a void quarter above his head, and as the sword waves about, over your head, set in your left foot. Then lightly, with the right hand and foot, thrust forth a thrust at his face, and thrust a Bow-thrust at his belly. Then smite a full Quarter, and another void, and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Dragon's Tail is the circular overhead motion—'as the sword waves about over your head' describes the sword tracing circles above you. This builds momentum for the subsequent thrusts while creating a defensive dome."[3]

> "The Pendant is likely the guard you transition to—sword hanging behind or below. The combination teaches flowing from circular defense (dragon's tail) to direct offense (thrusts)."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Dragon's Tail** = circular overhead motion
- **Pendant** = hanging guard position
- Right-hand control (one-handed)
- Circular motion builds momentum
- High-low thrust combination (face, belly)
- **Bow-thrust** appears again
- Coordination of hand and foot

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Circular motion defends/creates space
- Momentum transfers to thrusts
- High-low targeting forces split defense
- One-handed control demonstrates skill
- Returns safely to guard

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer + Rake | Stand | Standard opening |
| 2 | (Position) | Stand still | Stability for circles |
| 3 | Void quarter above head (right hand) | Stand | One-handed, defensive high |
| 4 | **Dragon's Tail** | Stand | Sword circles/waves overhead |
| 5 | (Transition) | Set in left foot | Advance while circling |
| 6 | **Thrust to face** | Right hand and foot (lightly) | High-line thrust |
| 7 | **Bow-thrust to belly** | Stand | Low-line thrust |
| 8 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Safety cut |
| 9 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 10 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE DRAGON'S TAIL MOTION

**"As the Sword Wavyth About":**

**Circular Overhead:**
- Sword circles above head
- Continuous motion
- Like helicopter rotor
- Creates defensive sphere
- Point describes circles

**Right Hand Control:**
- One-handed execution
- Right hand (rear hand) leads
- Requires strength and control
- Left hand free or guiding lightly

**Function:**

**Defensive:**
- Attacks from above = blocked by circle
- Creates space around head/body
- Opponent hesitates to enter
- "Waving sword" = psychological barrier

**Offensive Preparation:**
- Circles build momentum
- Rotational energy
- Transfers into thrusts
- Power from movement

**Visual Impact:**
- Impressive display
- Demonstrates control
- Intimidating
- But substance over showmanship

#### THE PENDANT GUARD

**What Is Pendant:**

From Latin *pendere* = to hang

**Position:**
- Sword hanging down
- Point low or behind body
- Handle above
- Relaxed but ready

**Types of Pendant:**
- **Front Pendant:** Point down in front
- **Side Pendant:** Point down to side
- **Rear Pendant:** Point down behind
- **Dragon's Tail Pendant:** Likely rear or side

**Tactical Use:**
- Rest position (conserves energy)
- Deceptive (hides intent)
- Loads gravity for rising cuts
- Transitions easily to thrusts

**In This Technique:**
Likely the position sword arrives at after circular motion before thrusts.

#### BOW-THRUST TECHNIQUE

**The Bow-Thrust Reappears:**

Appeared in Fourth Chase. Now in Dragon's Tail. What is it?

**Most Likely Interpretation:**

**Arcing Thrust:**
- Doesn't travel straight
- Curves around defense
- "Bow" describes arc trajectory
- Enters from unexpected angle

**Execution:**
1. First thrust to face (straight)
2. Opponent guards face
3. Bow-thrust arcs around guard
4. Hits belly from side/angle
5. Bypasses frontal defense

**Alternative: Half-Sword**
- Close-range technique
- Grip on blade
- Arms form bow shape
- Powerful controlled thrust

**Training:**
Practice both interpretations. Use what works against specific defenses.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Overhead Circles**
- Right hand only
- Circle sword overhead
- Continuous motion (30 seconds)
- Build endurance and control
- Maintain smooth circles

**Week 2: Add Movement**
- Circle while stepping
- Set in left foot while circling
- Maintain balance
- Don't let circles wobble

**Week 3: Circle to Thrust Transition**
- Complete circles
- Stop circular motion
- Immediately thrust
- Use momentum from circles
- Smooth transition

**Week 4: High-Low Thrust Sequence**
- Face thrust (straight)
- Bow-thrust to belly (arcing)
- Quick succession
- Opponent can't defend both
- Build combination

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Proffer-rake opening
- Circular dragon's tail
- Thrust combination
- Safety sequence
- Complete technique

**Week 6+: One-Handed Strength**
- Increase circle duration
- Add resistance (heavier sword)
- Faster circles
- Build right-arm strength
- Develop stamina

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak overhead circles—must genuinely defend
- Both hands on sword—should be right-hand controlled
- Irregular circles—maintain consistent size/speed
- Dizziness from watching circles—eyes on opponent
- Pausing between circles and thrusts—should flow
- Straight belly thrust instead of bow-thrust—loses advantage
- Forgetting safety sequence—always needed

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**

**Against Overhead Attacks:**
- Opponent favors high strikes
- Dragon's tail defends high line
- While defending, prepare counter
- Thrust combination finishes

**Creating Space:**
- Opponent presses close
- Circular motion pushes them back
- Psychological barrier
- Regain distance control

**Demonstrating Skill:**
- Tournament or teaching context
- Show control and capability
- Intimidate through technique
- But only if you can execute well

**Transition Technique:**
- From defense to offense
- Circles provide thinking time
- Assess opponent
- Launch when ready

#### RIGHT-HAND COORDINATION

**"With the Right Hand and Foot":**

**Right Hand Thrust:**
- Rear hand becomes thrust hand
- Must release left hand or shift grip
- Right hand drives thrust
- Power from rear

**Right Foot Follows:**
- Right foot steps forward
- Same-side coordination
- Like walking (natural)
- Extends reach
- Balanced position

**Why This Works:**
- Natural motion pattern
- Maximum reach
- Strong power transfer
- Can recover quickly

**Training:**
- Practice right-hand only thrusts
- Coordinate with right foot step
- Build strength in rear hand
- Develop ambidextrous capability

#### PARTNER DRILL: "CIRCLE DEFENSE TEST"

**Setup:**
- You execute Dragon's Tail circles
- Partner attempts to attack overhead
- Your circles should prevent their attack

**Test:**
- Can partner find opening in circles?
- Do circles genuinely defend?
- Or are they decorative only?

**Success:**
- Partner cannot safely attack overhead
- Circles create real barrier
- Opponent must respect the motion

**Failure:**
- Partner finds openings
- Circles too slow or irregular
- No defensive value

**Adjustment:**
- Increase circle speed
- Improve consistency
- Extend sword further
- Build true defense

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: CIRCULAR GUARDS

**Rotating Defenses:**

Multiple traditions use circular motions:

**Japanese *Jodan Kamae*:**
- Overhead guard with movement
- Sword moves to track opponent
- Circular patterns common

**European *Zornhut* Variations:**
- Wrath guard with motion
- Sword circles threateningly
- Psychological and practical

**Chinese *Bagua* Circular Walking:**
- Entire martial art based on circles
- Continuous circular motion
- Defense through movement

**Universal Principle:**
Circles are harder to penetrate than lines. Moving target harder to hit than static.

#### THE NAME: "DRAGON'S TAIL"

**Why This Name:**

**Dragon Imagery:**
- Medieval European dragons
- Powerful tail described in legends
- Whipping, dangerous
- Sweeping motion

**Tail Motion:**
- Like dragon's tail whipping
- Circular sweeping
- Defensive but threatening
- Natural metaphor

**Cultural Context:**
Dragons were culturally significant:
- Heraldry (Wales, England)
- Literature (Beowulf)
- Religious symbolism (St. George)
- Martial metaphor appropriate

**Modern Use:**
The name evokes the technique's nature—defensive circular motion with power and threat.
