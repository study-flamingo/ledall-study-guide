### CHAPTER 20: THE FIRST POINT OF THE COUNTER

**Original Text:** *The Firſte poynte off ye Counter A pfur a rake wt a quartr full ſtandyng ſtyll pley an other voyde above hys hede wyth an other at hys legge then voyde bake the ryght legge wt an other quartr And be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter standing still, play another void above his head with another at his leg, then void back the right leg with another Quarter and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The First Counter establishes the foundational pattern for all Counters: proffer (draw attack) → defensive action (rake) → offensive response (quarters) → safety (void + quarter) → return to guard (stop). Master this structure before attempting complex Counters."[3]

> "The high-low combination (void above head, attack leg) forces opponent to defend multiple lines simultaneously. They can't protect both targets adequately, creating openings."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Foundational Counter pattern** - all others build on this
- Proffer-rake-quarter = standard opening
- High-low attack combination
- "Stop" = ending guard position
- Three quarters total (hence sometimes called "3 Quarters")
- Creates safety through void + quarter retreat

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Draw opponent's attack (proffer)
- Disrupt their attack (rake)
- Pressure multiple targets (high-low)
- Create safe distance (void + quarter)
- Return to defensive readiness (stop)

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Bait opening, draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks proffer | Advances | Falls into trap |
| 2 | Rake | Stand or slight void | Harassment cut to hands/arms |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand still | "Full" = committed cut |
| 4 | Void above head | Stand | Defensive evasion high |
| 5 | Attack to leg | Stand | Low-line strike |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back right leg | Cut while retreating |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Return to defensive position |

#### THE COUNTER PATTERN STRUCTURE

**Phase 1: Setup (Steps 1-2)**
- Proffer creates opportunity
- Rake responds to opponent's bite

**Phase 2: Offense (Steps 3-5)**
- Quarter pressures
- High void forces reaction
- Leg attack exploits opening

**Phase 3: Safety (Steps 6-7)**
- Void back creates distance
- Quarter maintains threat during retreat
- Stop guard readies next action

**This Three-Phase Structure:**
Appears in nearly all Counters with variations. Understanding it allows prediction of Counter flow even when details differ.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Proffer-Rake-Quarter**
- Practice opening sequence
- Partner provides attacks to proffer
- Smooth rake response
- Full quarter after rake
- No hesitation between actions

**Week 2: Add High-Low**
- Void above head (defensive)
- Attack to leg (offensive)
- Quick transition high→low
- Partner observes if they could defend both

**Week 3: Add Safety Sequence**
- Void back right leg
- Quarter during retreat
- Stop guard position
- Complete First Counter

**Week 4: Partner Pressure**
- Partner attacks proffer aggressively
- You execute full Counter
- Partner tries to counter your Counter
- Test if safety sequence works

**Week 5+: Tactical Application**
- Use in light sparring
- Vary proffer types
- Adjust timing based on opponent
- Document what works

#### HIGH-LOW ATTACK THEORY

**Why This Combination Works:**

**Physiological Limitations:**
- Eyes can't track two distant targets simultaneously
- Upper body and lower body guards conflict
- Defending high exposes low
- Defending low exposes high

**Temporal Advantage:**
- Void high forces reaction
- Attack low exploits reaction time
- Opponent can't recover guard fast enough
- Opening appears during transition

**Psychological Impact:**
- Uncertainty about which target is real
- Both seem threatening
- Analysis paralysis
- Hesitation creates further openings

#### THE "STOP" GUARD

**Understanding Stop:**

The term "stop" appears at end of every Counter. Brandon Heslop defines it:

> "Stop is not merely ending position—it's a specific guard designed to stop opponent's counter-attack. It must be defensive, balanced, and ready for immediate action."[3]

**Characteristics of Stop Guard:**
- Blade threatens opponent
- Body balanced
- Weight distributed for movement
- Ready to attack OR defend
- Can transition to any other guard

**Possible Positions:**
- **Stop Guard** (German *Pflug*): Hands low, point threatening
- **Roebuck** (German *Ochs*): Point high, ready to thrust
- **Boar** (*Alber*): Low guard, inviting attack
- **Hawk** (*Vom Tag*): High guard, ready to cut

**Key Point:**
"Stop" is functional description, not always same physical position. Choose based on tactical situation.

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Obvious proffer that doesn't deceive opponent
- Weak rake that doesn't disrupt attack
- Pausing between quarter and high-low sequence
- High void without commitment (opponent sees it's fake)
- Leg attack too weak to threaten
- Not voiding far enough on retreat
- Forgetting stop guard—finishing exposed
- Mechanical execution without tactical awareness

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent is aggressive, attacks openings
- You want to test their defensive capabilities
- Need simple, reliable counter pattern
- Teaching moment (establish fundamentals)
- Against impulsive fencers

**Setup Opportunities:**
- After establishing pattern of proffers
- When opponent begins anticipating your attacks
- During mid-bout when both settling into rhythm
- Against opponents who commit fully to attacks

**What This Teaches Opponent:**
- Your proffers are traps
- Attacking you has consequences
- You can defend high and low
- You retreat safely, not in panic
- They must be more careful

#### COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: FIRST VS. FIFTH VS. SIXTEENTH COUNTERS

All three are called or similar to "3 Quarters":

**First Counter:**
- High-low combination
- Standard retreat pattern
- Foundational teaching

**Fifth Counter** (covered earlier):
- Also high-low
- Slightly different footwork
- Same principle

**Sixteenth Counter** (coming later):
- Same pattern again
- Repetition emphasizes importance
- Variants teach adaptation

**Why Repetition?**
Medieval pedagogy emphasized repetition with variation:
- Core pattern drilled repeatedly
- Slight variations develop adaptability
- Student learns principle, not just technique
- Can improvise when principle understood

#### PARTNER DRILL: "THE PROFFER GAME"

**Setup:**
- Partner A creates proffers
- Partner B attacks or doesn't attack
- Partner A must execute Counter if B attacks
- Partner A must NOT execute if B doesn't attack

**Scoring:**
- B attacks, A counters successfully: A gets point
- B attacks, A fails to counter: B gets point
- B doesn't attack, A executes anyway: B gets point
- B doesn't attack, A holds back: A gets point

**Goal:**
Develops:
- Proffer authenticity (must look real)
- Attack recognition (when to execute)
- Response speed (react to actual attack)
- Restraint (don't waste Counter on nothing)

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: THE COUNTER CONCEPT

The term "Counter" itself is significant:

**Medieval Meaning:**
- Response to opponent's action
- Not proactive attack
- Reactive but not passive
- Turns opponent's attack against them

**English Emphasis:**
Unlike German *Meisterhau* (master strikes - proactive attacks), English Counters are predominantly reactive. This reflects:
- Self-defense orientation
- Conservative tactical philosophy
- Legal context (defense more justifiable)
- Civilian application (not battlefield)

**George Silver's Later Codification:**
Silver explicitly discusses "true times" and "false times":
- True time = when opponent is committed
- False time = when opponent can still adjust

Counters exploit true times—opponent committed to proffer attack, can't easily adapt to your high-low combination.[7]

### CHAPTER 21: THE THIRD COUNTER - "THE SHORT-SPRING, WITH A FALLING-STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The thyrde Counter callyd ye ſhort ſpryng wt a fallyng ſtroke A pfur a rake wt a full quartr lythly ſett In ye lyffte legge wt the lyffte honde put yor ſwerde be hynde ye ſhudyr and throſte owte a full ſpryng att hys face wt a quartr and an other voyde and be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a full Quarter, lithely set in the left leg with the left hand, put your sword behind the shoulder and thrust out a Full-spring at his face with a Quarter and another void and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The 'Short-Spring with a Falling-Stroke' combines compact spring technique with a descending angle. The sword behind shoulder creates an overhead position that the spring 'falls' from—unexpected and difficult to defend."[3]

> "Notice the left-hand emphasis again. Putting sword behind shoulder with the forward hand creates maximum deception—opponent can't see the blade or judge the angle until it's too late."[5]

**Key Points:**
- "Lithely" = quickly, lightly (no telegraphing)
- **Sword behind shoulder** = unique guard position  
- **Left hand** = forward hand controls sword
- "Falling-stroke" = spring descends from high position
- Target is face (high-line attack)
- Compact spring (short) but full commitment

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Behind-shoulder position hides intention
- Falling angle surprises opponent
- Short spring = faster than full spring
- Face target creates immediate threat
- Quick execution prevents counter

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | (Transition) | Set in left leg (lithely) | Quick advance |
| 5 | Sword behind shoulder (left hand) | Stand | Left hand positioning |
| 6 | **Full-spring to face** | Extended stance | Descending "falling" angle |
| 7 | Quarter | Stand or void | Safety cut |
| 8 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 9 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### SWORD BEHIND SHOULDER TECHNIQUE

**Physical Position:**

**Behind the Shoulder:**
- Sword rests on or behind left shoulder
- Point high and back
- Left hand (forward hand) controls
- Right hand releases or guides lightly

**Possible Variations:**

**Version A: On Shoulder**
- Blade rests on shoulder
- Like carrying weapon
- Point extended high-back
- Spring emerges from overhead

**Version B: Behind Neck**
- Handle behind neck/head
- Point extends to rear
- Most concealment
- Most awkward position

**Version C: Over Shoulder**
- Blade arcs over shoulder
- Point down opponent's right side
- Creates angle attack
- Spring comes from side-high

#### THE "FALLING-STROKE" CONCEPT

**What Makes It "Falling":**

**Gravity-Assisted:**
- Spring originates from high position
- Descends toward target
- Uses gravity for momentum
- Like dropping vs. throwing

**Execution:**
1. Sword behind shoulder (high position)
2. Weight shifts forward
3. Arm extends and drops
4. Point falls toward face
5. Gravity accelerates the strike

**Comparison:**
- **Standard spring:** Horizontal thrust
- **Falling spring:** Diagonal descent
- **Advantage:** Unexpected angle, gravity-assisted

#### SHORT-SPRING VS. FULL-SPRING

The manuscript distinguishes:

**Short-Spring:**
- Compact extension
- Faster execution
- Less reach
- More control
- Less commitment

**Full-Spring:**
- Maximum extension
- Slower execution (more movement)
- Greater reach
- Less control
- Full commitment

**In This Counter:**
Text says "Full-spring" but title says "Short-Spring"—possible contradiction or the spring is full commitment but short duration.

**Modern Interpretation:**
- Short setup (compact positioning)
- Full commitment (genuine threat)
- Best of both

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Behind-Shoulder Position**
- Explore different shoulder positions
- Find which conceals best
- Find which generates most power
- Practice with left hand only
- Select one version to master

**Week 2: Falling Mechanics**
- Spring from high position downward
- Feel gravity assist
- Control the descent
- Target accuracy (face)
- Repeat 20 times daily

**Week 3: Opening Sequence**
- Proffer-rake-quarter
- Quick set-in with left leg
- Smooth transition to shoulder position
- No fumbling
- Fluid motion

**Week 4: Full Integration**
- Complete Third Counter
- Opening → behind shoulder → spring → safety
- Partner evaluates surprise factor
- Adjust positioning if telegraphed

**Week 5+: Speed and Commitment**
- "Lithely" means quick
- No hesitation on set-in
- Explosive spring
- Test against partner resistance

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Slow set-in with left leg—must be "lithely"
- Telegraphing by looking where spring will go
- Complicated shoulder transition—keep simple
- Weak spring from awkward position—must commit
- Forgetting it's left hand leading—not right
- Horizontal spring instead of falling angle
- Poor recovery (quarter + void)—critical for safety
- Not selecting consistent shoulder position—master one

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent defends well against standard springs
- Need unexpected angle
- Opponent focuses on center-line defense
- Want to test high-line defense
- After establishing horizontal attack patterns

**Psychological Impact:**
- Opponent sees shoulder position (confusion)
- Can't judge blade location
- Spring appears from unexpected angle
- Creates fear of high attacks
- Future feints to shoulder become effective

#### DECEPTION THROUGH POSITIONING

**The Left-Hand Principle:**

Multiple Counters emphasize left (forward) hand:
- Third Counter (this one)
- Tenth Counter (Snatch)
- Twelfth Chase (sword behind head)

**Why Left Hand?**

**Mechanical:**
- Forward hand closer to opponent
- Can extend further
- More control at close range
- Right hand free for recovery

**Deceptive:**
- Unusual (most fight two-handed)
- Unexpected capability
- Opponent doesn't track forward hand as threat
- Creates surprise

**Training:**
Build left-hand strength and control:
- One-handed cuts (left only)
- Left-hand springs
- Wrist exercises (left)
- Forearm development (left)

#### PARTNER DRILL: "FALLING SPRING ACCURACY"

**Setup:**
- Partner holds target at face height
- You execute Third Counter
- Measure if spring actually threatens face

**Success Criteria:**
- Spring must hit target zone (face)
- Must arrive from descending angle
- Must generate from shoulder position
- Must surprise partner (they shouldn't see it coming)

**Scoring:**
- Hit face zone: 3 points
- Hit general head area: 1 point
- Miss entirely: 0 points
- Partner anticipates: -1 point

**Goal:**
- Consistent face targeting
- True "falling" angle
- Surprise maintained

#### COMPARATIVE TECHNIQUE: 12TH CHASE

The Twelfth Chase also uses sword-behind-head positioning:

**Similarities:**
- Unusual guard position
- Left hand emphasis
- Deceptive intent
- Spring to face

**Differences:**
- 12th Chase: Behind head
- 3rd Counter: Behind shoulder
- Different angles
- Different tactical contexts

**Learning Value:**
Practice both to understand:
- Range of deceptive positions
- Multiple angle attacks
- Adaptability with unusual guards

### CHAPTER 22: THE FOURTH COUNTER - "THE RABETT WITH A DOWN-RIGHT STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The iiijth callyd the Rabett wt a Downe ryght Stroke A pfur A rake wt a quartr ſett In your lyffte legge wt a rabett then ſett In youre ryght legge wt a downeryght Stroke wt bothe handſ wyth a foyne and a quartr wt an other voyde be att yor ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter. Set in your left leg with a Rabett, then set in your right leg with a Down-right stroke with both hands, with a thrust and a Quarter with another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fourth Counter is the first to prominently feature the Rabett—the countercut against opponent's weapon. This Counter teaches how rabett creates openings for powerful follow-up attacks."[3]

> "Notice the aggressive pattern: two steps forward (left then right), rabett for control, downright for power, thrust for finishing. This is overwhelming pressure that forces opponent backward or into error."[5]

**Key Points:**
- First Counter featuring **Rabett prominently**
- Two-step advance (left → right) = aggressive
- Downright stroke "with both hands" = power strike
- Thrust follows downright = combination
- Rabett controls → Downright damages
- Ends with standard safety sequence

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Rabett controls opponent's blade
- First step (left + rabett) closes distance
- Second step (right + downright) delivers power
- Thrust exploits opening downright creates
- Safety sequence prevents counter-attack

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Bait opening |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg | Advance + countercut weapon |
| 5 | **Downright stroke** | Set in right leg | Advance + power cut (two hands) |
| 6 | Thrust (foyne) | Stand | Follow-up to downright |
| 7 | Quarter | Stand | Safety cut |
| 8 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 9 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE RABETT TECHNIQUE

**Detailed Explanation:**

The Rabett is fundamental to English longsword but rarely explained clearly. Here's comprehensive breakdown:

**What It Is:**
- Cut delivered **against** opponent's weapon
- Not past their blade—**into** their blade
- Deflects their weapon
- Establishes your position
- Sets up follow-up attack

**How It Works:**

**Mechanics:**
1. Opponent's blade presents
2. You cut toward their blade
3. Your blade impacts theirs
4. Percussion (strike) displaces their weapon
5. Displacement creates opening
6. You attack into opening

**Energy Transfer:**
- Your cut's force transfers to their blade
- Their blade moves (whether they want it to or not)
- Movement creates gap in defense
- Gap = target opportunity

**Comparison:**
- **German *Dempfhau*:** Similar—damping/deadening cut
- **Parry:** Blocks but doesn't necessarily create opening
- **Rabett:** Actively creates offensive opportunity

#### TWO-STEP ADVANCE PATTERN

**Aggressive Footwork:**

**Step 1 (Left + Rabett):**
- Close distance
- Control opponent's blade
- Establish position
- Prepare for power strike

**Step 2 (Right + Downright):**
- Further advance
- Deliver power cut
- Exploit rabett's opening
- Two hands = maximum force

**Why This Works:**

**Momentum:**
- First step builds momentum
- Second step maintains momentum
- Opponent must retreat or defend desperately
- Continuous pressure prevents recovery

**Distance Collapse:**
- Two steps cover 4-6 feet
- Collapses distance rapidly
- Opponent can't maintain safe range
- Forces engagement

**Psychological:**
- Aggressive advance intimidating
- Continuous movement prevents thought
- Opponent reacts instinctively (poorly)
- Creates errors you exploit

#### DOWNRIGHT STROKE "WITH BOTH HANDS"

**Emphasis on Two Hands:**

Most cuts use two hands, but manuscript specifically states it here. Why?

**Maximum Power:**
- Both hands driving
- Full body weight
- No holding back
- Committed strike

**After Rabett:**
- Rabett may be one-handed or light
- Downright is explicitly powerful
- Contrast emphasizes downright's force
- Opponent feels the difference

**Target Selection:**
Downright after rabett likely targets:
- **Head:** Exposed after rabett displaces high guard
- **Shoulder:** Exposed after rabett displaces side guard
- **Hands/Arms:** If rabett pushed their blade wide

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Rabett Mechanics**
- Partner presents blade
- You cut into their blade (rabett)
- Feel percussion/displacement
- Note how their blade moves
- Practice slow, focus on technique

**Week 2: Rabett + Downright**
- Rabett displaces blade
- Immediately downright to opening
- Partner observes: did rabett create opening?
- If not, rabett wasn't effective enough
- Adjust angle/force

**Week 3: Add Footwork**
- Set in left leg with rabett
- Set in right leg with downright
- Continuous motion
- No pause between steps
- Build aggression

**Week 4: Add Thrust**
- Downright creates impact
- Opponent recoils or guards
- Thrust exploits their reaction
- Quick transition downright→thrust
- Partner pressure-tests

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Opening (proffer-rake-quarter)
- Main sequence (rabett-downright-thrust)
- Safety (quarter-void-stop)
- Complete Fourth Counter
- Speed and power

**Week 6+: Partner Resistance**
- Partner doesn't yield to rabett easily
- You must commit more force
- Partner counters during sequence
- You must maintain aggression
- Develop real-combat capability

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak rabett that doesn't displace blade
- Pausing between left step and right step
- Weak downright despite "both hands" instruction
- Thrust too slow after downright—must be immediate
- Not advancing far enough—two steps should cover ground
- Losing balance during aggressive advance
- Forgetting safety sequence—still vulnerable after thrust

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent uses passive defense
- They wait for your attack
- You want to overwhelm with aggression
- Their blade positioning is predictable
- You have stamina advantage

**Against Defensive Fencers:**
Perfect for opponents who:
- Don't initiate attacks
- Rely on counter-attacks
- Use waiting strategy
- Hope you'll tire yourself

**Your Approach:**
- Proffer draws their attention
- Rake prevents them settling
- Rabett controls their blade
- Downright forces desperate defense
- Thrust catches them during recovery

**Result:**
- Opponent on back foot
- Forced to react
- Can't execute their plan
- Must defend continuously
- Eventually makes mistake

#### RABETT TARGET AREAS

**Where to Rabett:**

**Flat of Blade:**
- Most effective displacement
- Transfers energy efficiently
- Minimal sword damage

**Strong of Blade:**
- Against weak of opponent's blade
- Maximum leverage
- Greatest displacement

**Avoid:**
- Edge-to-edge (damages swords)
- Weak-to-strong (they have leverage)
- Air (missing entirely)

**Target Selection:**
- High rabett: Displaces overhead guards
- Mid rabett: Displaces center guards
- Low rabett: Displaces low guards

Choose based on opponent's current guard.

#### COMBINATION THEORY

**Rabett-Downright-Thrust:**

This three-technique combination teaches fundamental principle:

**Control → Damage → Finish:**
1. **Rabett** (Control): Establish position
2. **Downright** (Damage): Exploit position
3. **Thrust** (Finish): Complete attack

**This Pattern:**
Appears throughout martial arts:
- Wrestling: Control → Takedown → Pin
- Boxing: Jab (setup) → Cross (power) → Hook (finish)
- Fencing: Preparation → Attack → Continuation

**Principle:**
Never rely on single technique. Combinations force opponent to defend multiple threats, creating openings.

#### PARTNER DRILL: "RABETT EFFECTIVENESS TEST"

**Setup:**
- Partner holds guard position
- You execute rabett
- Measure: How far did their blade move?

**Scoring:**
- Blade displaced 6+ inches: Effective rabett (3 points)
- Blade displaced 3-6 inches: Adequate (1 point)
- Blade displaced <3 inches: Ineffective (0 points)

**Goal:**
Rabett must genuinely displace. If blade doesn't move, your follow-up attacks won't have opening to exploit.

**Adjustment:**
- More force
- Better angle
- Commit body weight
- Use whole blade, not just tip

### CHAPTER 23: THE FIFTH COUNTER - "THE 3 QUARTERS"

**Original Text:** *The Vth callyd the iij quarters A pfur a rake wyth a quarter full ſtanding ſtylle pley an other voyde a bove hys hede wt an other at hys legge then voyde bake the ryght legge wt an other quarter and be att youre ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter full. Standing still play another void above his head, with another at his leg. Then void back the right leg with another Quarter and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fifth Counter is nearly identical to the First Counter—this repetition emphasizes the importance of the high-low attack pattern. Medieval training relied on drilling core techniques repeatedly with slight variations."[3]

> "The key difference is subtle: 'standing still' is explicitly stated before the high-low sequence. This emphasizes the stable platform required for effective multi-target attacks."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Almost identical to First Counter**
- Repetition emphasizes core pattern
- "Standing still" explicitly noted
- Three quarters = name source
- High-low combination again
- Foundational technique worth repeating

**Why Repeat This Pattern:**
- Core competency requires mastery
- Slight variations build adaptability
- Students learn principles, not just choreography
- Repetition with variation = deep learning
- Can execute instinctively under pressure

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | **Standing still** | Explicitly stable |
| 4 | Void above head | Stand still | High defensive action |
| 5 | Attack to leg | Stand still | Low offensive action |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back right leg | Retreat while cutting |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE "STANDING STILL" EMPHASIS

**Why State the Obvious?**

Most techniques involve standing still at some point. Why emphasize it here?

**Stability for Multi-Target:**
- High-low sequence requires balance
- Moving while attacking multiple targets = difficult
- Standing still = stable platform
- Stability = accuracy and power

**Contrast with Movement:**
- Many Counters involve footwork throughout
- This one explicitly stops moving
- Creates rhythm change
- Opponent expects movement, gets stability

**Tactical Consideration:**
- Standing still can be vulnerable
- But multi-target attack compensates
- Opponent can't counter if defending multiple lines
- Trade mobility for offensive capability

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Review First Counter**
- Ensure First Counter is mastered
- Same pattern as Fifth
- Smooth execution
- No hesitation

**Week 2: Emphasize Stability**
- Execute Fifth Counter
- Focus on "standing still"
- Plant feet firmly
- No shifting during high-low
- Solid platform

**Week 3: Compare and Contrast**
- Alternate First and Fifth Counters
- Identify subtle differences
- Understand why repetition matters
- Build instinctive execution

**Week 4+: Variations**
- Change which leg voids (left vs right)
- Vary high void intensity
- Vary leg attack target (knee vs ankle vs thigh)
- Develop adaptability within pattern

#### REPETITION IN MEDIEVAL PEDAGOGY

**Why Multiple "3 Quarters" Counters?**

The manuscript includes:
- First Counter (3 quarters pattern)
- Fifth Counter (3 quarters - this one)
- Sixteenth Counter (also 3 quarters)

**Medieval Learning Theory:**

**Repetitio Mater Studiorum:**
"Repetition is the mother of learning" (Latin maxim)

**How It Works:**
1. First presentation: Learn sequence
2. Second presentation: Refine execution
3. Third presentation: Instinctive mastery
4. Variations: Develop adaptability

**Modern Equivalent:**
- Drilling in martial arts
- Scales in music
- Fundamental exercises in sports
- Core competencies repeated until automatic

**Application:**
Don't view repetition as redundancy. View as:
- Emphasis on importance
- Opportunity for perfection
- Building deep competency
- Creating instinctive responses

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Rushing through because "I already know this from First Counter"
- Not emphasizing standing still—allowing drift
- Weak execution because it's "just repetition"
- Failing to find subtle differences
- Not using repetition to perfect technique
- Skipping in favor of "more interesting" techniques

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Why Return to This Pattern:**

Even experienced fencers should drill Fifth Counter because:

**Fundamentals Win Fights:**
- Complex techniques fail under pressure
- Simple, well-drilled techniques succeed
- High-low is always effective
- Can execute when tired, stressed, injured

**Building Blocks:**
- More complex Counters build on this
- If foundation shaky, complex fails
- Perfect this = can learn anything

**Reliability:**
- Works against novices
- Works against experts
- Works when tired
- Works under pressure
- Core competency never obsolete

#### PARTNER DRILL: "PERFECT EXECUTION"

**Goal:**
Execute Fifth Counter with zero errors.

**Criteria:**
- Proffer convincing
- Rake threatens
- Quarter commits
- Stand absolutely still (no drift)
- High void genuine
- Leg attack threatens
- Void back creates distance
- Stop guard solid

**Scoring:**
- Partner identifies any flaw: Start over
- 10 perfect executions in row: Success
- Track time to achieve 10 perfect reps

**Purpose:**
Perfection drill. Not about speed or power—about flawless execution. Builds:
- Attention to detail
- Technical precision
- Muscle memory
- Pride in craft

#### MEDITATIVE PRACTICE

**Solo Drill:**

The Fifth Counter can be used as **moving meditation**:

**Setup:**
1. Quiet space
2. No partner
3. Slow speed
4. Focus on perfection

**Execution:**

### CHAPTER 24: THE SIXTH COUNTER - "THE CROSS RAKE"

**Original Text:** *The Vjth Poynte callyde the cros Rake A pfur a cros rake wt a foyne at hys face wt a quarter full and an other A voyde be at youre ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Cross-Rake, with a thrust at his face with a Quarter full and another, a void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Cross-Rake is the signature technique here—likely a diagonal cutting motion across opponent's blade or body, creating a unique angle that disrupts their defense differently than standard rake."[3]

> "This Counter is notably simpler than recent ones. The focus is mastering the cross-rake technique itself rather than complex sequencing."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Cross-Rake** = diagonal or crossing rake motion
- No standard rake—jumps straight to cross-rake
- Thrust to face follows immediately
- Simpler pattern than most Counters
- Focus on mastering cross-rake angle
- "Another" likely means another quarter

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Cross-rake creates unexpected angle
- Diagonal motion confuses defense
- Face thrust is kill-shot
- Simplicity allows focus on technique quality
- Speed over complexity

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | **Cross-Rake** | Stand or slight movement | Diagonal/crossing cut |
| 3 | Thrust to face | Stand or extend | High-line thrust |
| 4 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 5 | Another (quarter) | Stand | Second cut |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE CROSS-RAKE TECHNIQUE

**What "Cross" Means:**

The term "cross" in medieval English fencing context suggests:

**Interpretation 1: Diagonal Angle**
- Rake delivered diagonally
- Crosses opponent's centerline
- From high-right to low-left (or reverse)
- Creates unexpected angle

**Interpretation 2: Crossing Motion**
- Blade crosses opponent's blade
- Sweeping motion across their weapon
- Displaces while cutting
- Combines rake + displacement

**Interpretation 3: Cross-Body**
- Cut crosses your own body
- Right-to-left or left-to-right
- Uses torso rotation
- Generates power from hip

**Most Likely: Combination**
All three elements probably apply:
- Diagonal angle
- Crosses opponent's blade
- Uses body rotation

#### CROSS-RAKE MECHANICS

**Execution:**

**Setup:**
- Opponent attacks proffer
- Their blade presents
- You identify angle

**The Cross:**
1. Rotate hips/shoulders
2. Blade sweeps diagonally
3. Contact opponent's blade or hands
4. Continues across (doesn't stop on contact)
5. Creates opening

**Follow-Through:**
- Momentum from cross-rake
- Transitions into thrust position
- No pause between rake and thrust
- Continuous motion

**Power Source:**
- Hip rotation
- Shoulder engagement
- Whole body, not just arms
- Diagonal motion generates torque

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Explore Cross-Rake Angles**
- Try various diagonal angles
- High-right to low-left
- High-left to low-right
- Low-right to high-left
- Low-left to high-right
- Find which feels most natural

**Week 2: Cross-Rake Against Blade**
- Partner presents blade
- You cross-rake it
- Observe displacement
- Adjust angle for maximum effect
- Build consistency

**Week 3: Cross-Rake to Thrust**
- Execute cross-rake
- Immediate thrust to face
- No pause between
- Momentum flows rake→thrust
- Partner pressure-tests timing

**Week 4: Add Opening and Closing**
- Proffer to draw attack
- Cross-rake response
- Thrust to face
- Two quarters
- Void and stop
- Complete Sixth Counter

**Week 5+: Speed and Commitment**
- Increase execution speed
- Full commitment to thrust
- Test against partner resistance
- Develop instinctive cross-rake

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak cross-rake that doesn't displace or threaten
- Straight rake instead of diagonal (missing "cross")
- Pausing between cross-rake and thrust
- Weak thrust to face—should genuinely threaten
- Forgetting second quarter—text says "another"
- Not using body rotation—all in arms
- Losing balance from diagonal motion

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**

**Against Linear Defenders:**
- Opponent defends center-line well
- Standard rakes don't work
- Cross-angle surprises them
- Diagonal bypasses their defense

**Against Aggressive Attackers:**
- They attack your proffer hard
- Cross-rake deflects their attack
- Diagonal angle multiplies deflection
- Their momentum works against them

**Creating Angles:**
- Opponent settles into patterns
- Expects standard approaches
- Cross-rake breaks pattern
- Diagonal thinking = tactical advantage

#### DIAGONAL THEORY

**Why Diagonals Work:**

**Geometry:**
- Shortest distance between two points
- Diagonal crosses multiple defensive lines
- Hard to defend simultaneously
- Creates compound threat

**Physics:**
- Diagonal uses body rotation
- Rotation = power
- Leverages whole body
- More force than arm-only

**Psychology:**
- Humans defend in lines (horizontal, vertical)
- Diagonals less intuitive
- Requires more processing
- Slower reaction time

**Historical Precedent:**
- Italian *Fendente* (diagonal descending)
- German *Oberhau* (diagonal cut)
- Universal recognition of diagonal effectiveness

#### SIMPLICITY AS SOPHISTICATION

**Why This Counter Is Simple:**

**Not Fewer Steps = Easier:**
Rather: Focus on technique quality

**Design:**
- Cross-rake is new technique
- Rest is familiar (proffer, thrust, quarters)
- Can focus learning on cross-rake
- Don't overwhelm with complexity

**Pedagogical Wisdom:**
When introducing new technique:
- Keep surrounding context familiar
- Allow student to focus on new element
- Build confidence before adding complexity
- Foundation before elaboration

**Application:**
When teaching Sixth Counter:
- Assume student knows proffer, thrust, quarters
- Spend training time on cross-rake
- Perfect the new technique
- Then integrate into sequence

#### PARTNER DRILL: "CROSS-RAKE ANGLES"

**Setup:**
- Partner holds guard (any position)
- You experiment with cross-rake angles
- Partner reports which feels most threatening

**Test Angles:**
1. High-right to low-left
2. High-left to low-right
3. Mid-right to mid-left
4. Mid-left to mid-right
5. Low-right to high-left
6. Low-left to high-right

**Partner Feedback:**
- Which angle surprised most?
- Which was hardest to defend?
- Which generated most power?
- Which flowed best into thrust?

**Goal:**
Discover optimal cross-rake angle for your body and style.

#### CROSS-RAKE IN OTHER TRADITIONS

**Comparative Techniques:**

**Italian *Fendente*:**
- Diagonal descending cut
- Similar body mechanics
- Different tactical context
- Same geometric principle

**German *Zwerchau*:**
- "Cross cut"
- Horizontal with rotation
- Related concept
- Different execution

**Japanese *袈裟切り* (Kesa-giri):**
- "Monk's robe cut"
- Diagonal shoulder to hip
- Same angle concept
- Universal recognition

**Lesson:**
Diagonal cuts appear across martial traditions because they work. The English cross-rake is part of universal tactical wisdom.

### CHAPTER 25: THE SEVENTH COUNTER - "THE DOWN-RIGHT STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The Vijth poynte callyd ye Downeryght ſtroke A pfur A rake wyth a quarter an other a voyde a Downeryght Stroke folowyde wyth the ryght legge then ſtandyng ſtyll lythly play a fore foyne wt a quarter and an other voyde be att youre stope*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter, another, a void. A Down-right stroke followed with the right leg, then standing still lithely play a For-thrust, with a Quarter, and another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Seventh Counter introduces a mid-sequence void—you retreat before delivering the downright stroke. This teaches distance manipulation: void to draw opponent forward, downright as they pursue, thrust when they're committed."[3]

> "Notice 'lithely play a fore-thrust'—the quickness is emphasized. After the powerful downright, the quick thrust catches opponent during their reaction to the heavy strike."[5]

**Key Points:**
- Mid-sequence void (unusual placement)
- **Downright stroke** = signature technique
- Followed with right leg = advance while cutting
- "Lithely" fore-thrust = quick, light execution
- Power (downright) + speed (quick thrust) combination
- Two voids total (mid-sequence + ending)

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Void draws opponent forward
- Downright meets their advance
- Quick thrust exploits their reaction
- Power-speed combination overwhelms
- Multiple voids create safety

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | Another (action) | Stand | Likely another quarter |
| 5 | **Void** | Step back | **Mid-sequence retreat** |
| 6 | **Downright stroke** | Follow with right leg | Advance while cutting |
| 7 | (Preparation) | Stand still | Stable for thrust |
| 8 | Fore-thrust | Stand | **Lithely** = quick |
| 9 | Quarter | Stand | Safety cut |
| 10 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 11 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### MID-SEQUENCE VOID TACTIC

**Why Void Mid-Sequence?**

Most Counters void only at end (safety retreat). This one voids in the middle. Why?

**Drawing Opponent:**
- You void back (opponent thinks you're retreating)
- Opponent pursues (opportunity!)
- You downright as they advance
- They walk into your attack

**Distance Management:**
- Void creates space
- Downright collapses space
- You control the distance dynamic
- Opponent reacts to your manipulation

**Rhythm Disruption:**
- Opponent expects continuous forward pressure
- Void breaks their expectation
- They must adjust
- Adjustment creates opening

**Tactical Sophistication:**
This is advanced footwork—using retreat as setup for attack.

#### DOWNRIGHT STROKE DETAIL

**The Power Cut:**

**Execution:**
- Vertical or near-vertical descending cut
- Both hands driving
- Full body weight
- Gravity-assisted
- Maximum power

**"Followed with Right Leg":**
- Not static
- Advance as you cut
- Right leg steps forward
- Adds momentum to strike
- Closes distance

**Targets:**
- **Head:** Most common downright target
- **Shoulder:** If head defended
- **Hands:** If extended
- **Weapon:** To displace/destroy

**Difference from Quarter:**
- **Quarter:** Diagonal cut (45° angle)
- **Downright:** Vertical cut (90° angle)
- More direct
- More power
- Less finesse

#### THE "LITHELY" FORE-THRUST

**Quick and Light:**

After powerful downright, thrust must be:

**Quick ("Lithely"):**
- Fast execution
- No telegraphing
- Immediate after downright
- Surprise element

**Light (Also "Lithely"):**
- Not heavy commitment
- Can recover quickly
- Probing rather than killing blow
- Tests opponent's reaction

**Why This Combination:**

**Power → Speed:**
- Downright = heavy, slow
- Opponent braces for power
- Thrust = quick, unexpected
- Catches them unprepared

**Physical Response:**
- Heavy strike creates flinch/recoil
- During recoil, guard opens
- Quick thrust exploits opening
- Timing is everything

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Mid-Sequence Void**
- Practice opening (proffer-rake-quarter-another)
- Add void
- Partner observes: Do they want to pursue?
- If not void convincing enough, adjust

**Week 2: Downright After Void**
- Void back
- Partner pursues
- Downright as they advance
- Timing critical: too early = miss, too late = hit

**Week 3: Add Quick Thrust**
- After downright lands
- Immediate thrust (lithely)
- No pause
- Partner can't react in time
- Build speed

**Week 4: Complete Sequence**
- Opening → void → downright → thrust → safety
- All elements integrated
- Smooth transitions
- Tactical awareness

**Week 5+: Partner Pressure**
- Partner doesn't automatically pursue void
- Partner defends downright
- Partner tries to counter thrust
- You must adapt
- Develop real-combat capability

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak mid-void that doesn't draw opponent
- Downright while standing instead of advancing
- Heavy thrust instead of "lithely"
- Pausing between downright and thrust
- Second void (end) insufficient distance
- Not standing still before thrust—reduces control
- Forgetting "another" (step 4)—sequence has it

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**Against Aggressive Pursuers:**

**Their Pattern:**
- You retreat = they chase
- They pressure constantly
- They overwhelm with forward momentum

**Your Response:**
- Mid-void baits their chase
- Downright punishes pursuit
- Thrust finishes while they're reeling
- They learn: Don't chase blindly

**Psychological Training:**
Teaches opponent:
- Your retreats aren't weakness
- Pursuing you is dangerous
- Must respect your distance control
- Hesitation in future engagements

#### POWER-SPEED COMBINATIONS

**Fundamental Principle:**

The downright-thrust combination teaches:

**Heavy-Light Sequencing:**
- Heavy attack draws heavy defense
- Light attack exploits heavy defense
- Rhythm variation creates openings

**In Combat:**
- Never use same speed/weight twice
- Vary force continually
- Opponent can't settle into rhythm
- Creates constant uncertainty

**Other Applications:**
- Boxing: Jab (light) → Cross (heavy) → Hook (medium)
- Kendo: Men (heavy) → Kote (light)
- Fencing: Beat (heavy) → Disengage (light)

**Universal Principle:**
Variation defeats adaptation.

#### PARTNER DRILL: "PURSUE OR DON'T"

**Setup:**
- You execute opening + mid-void
- Partner decides: pursue or not
- You must read their intention
- Adapt accordingly

**If Partner Pursues:**
- Execute downright as written
- Catch them advancing
- Score success

**If Partner Doesn't Pursue:**
- Don't execute downright (they're not there)
- Adapt sequence
- Different counter required

**Goal:**
Develop:
- Tactical reading
- Adaptive execution
- Not robotic drilling
- Real decision-making

#### DOUBLE VOID SAFETY

**Why Two Voids:**

**Mid-Void (Step 5):**
- Tactical (draw opponent)
- Offensive purpose
- Setup for downright

**End-Void (Step 10):**
- Safety (create distance)
- Defensive purpose
- Return to guard

**Different Functions:**
Same action (void) serves different purposes based on context.

**Lesson:**
Techniques aren't inherently offensive or defensive—context determines purpose. Flexibility of mind = tactical advantage.

### CHAPTER 26: THE EIGHTH COUNTER - "THE RABETT WITH A DOWN-RIGHT STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The viijth callyde the rabett wt a Downe ryght Stroke A pfur a rake wt a quarter A nother A voyde a Downe ryght stroke folowyde wt the ryght legge wt a fore foyne ſettyng In the lyffte legge lyththly pley a rabett then ſett In ye ryght legge wt a Downryght Stroke a foyne wt a quarter an other a voyde be att yor ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter, another, a void. A Down-right stroke followed with the right leg, with a For-thrust. Setting in the left leg lithely play a Rabett, then set in the right leg with a Down-right stroke, a thrust, with a Quarter, another, a void, be at you stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Eighth Counter is the most complex Counter encountered so far—thirteen distinct actions including two rabetts, two downright strokes, and multiple advances. This teaches sustained pressure through combination attacks."[3]

> "Notice the pattern: void (draw) → downright + thrust → rabett (control) → downright + thrust again. The repetition teaches that successful combinations can be repeated when opponent is reeling."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Most complex Counter** (13 steps)
- Two separate rabett-downright combinations
- Multiple forward steps (highly aggressive)
- "Lithely" rabett = quick execution
- Double downright pattern teaches repetition
- Sustained pressure overwhelms defense

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Initial combination establishes pattern
- Opponent defends desperately
- Second combination exploits their fatigue/fear
- Continuous forward pressure
- No recovery time for opponent
- Forces error or retreat

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | Committed cut |
| 4 | Another | Stand | Likely quarter |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Mid-sequence retreat |
| **FIRST COMBINATION** | | | |
| 6 | Downright stroke | Follow with right leg | Power cut + advance |
| 7 | Fore-thrust | Stand | Quick thrust |
| **SECOND COMBINATION** | | | |
| 8 | Rabett | Set in left leg (lithely) | Quick advance + control |
| 9 | Downright stroke | Set in right leg | Power cut + advance |
| 10 | Thrust | Stand | Follow-up thrust |
| **SAFETY SEQUENCE** | | | |
| 11 | Quarter | Stand | Safety cut |
| 12 | Another | Stand | Second safety cut |
| 13 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 14 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### DOUBLE COMBINATION PATTERN

**First Combination (Steps 6-7):**
- Downright stroke (power)
- Fore-thrust (speed)
- Covers 2-3 feet forward

**Second Combination (Steps 8-10):**
- Rabett (control)
- Downright stroke (power)
- Thrust (finishing)
- Covers additional 2-3 feet forward

**Total Advance:**
4-6 feet forward in main sequence. Extremely aggressive.

#### WHY DOUBLE THE PATTERN

**Tactical Reasoning:**

**First Combination:**
- Tests opponent's defense
- Establishes rhythm
- Creates initial opening
- Applies pressure

**Opponent's Reaction:**
- Defends desperately
- Guard weakens
- Fatigue begins
- Fear increases

**Second Combination:**
- Exploits weakened defense
- Same pattern, harder to defend second time
- Opponent knows what's coming but can't stop it
- Psychological impact: "It's happening again"

**Teaching Principle:**
If combination works once, use it again immediately. Opponent is:
- Already damaged/disrupted
- Expecting something different
- Less prepared for repetition
- Easier to defeat

#### THE AGGRESSIVE ADVANCE

**Four Forward Steps:**

| Step | Leg | Action |
|------|-----|--------|
| 6 | Right | Downright stroke |
| 8 | Left | Rabett |
| 9 | Right | Downright stroke |
| Total | Both alternating | 4 forward steps |

**Distance Covered:**
- Each step: 1-2 feet
- Total: 4-6 feet forward
- Collapsing distance rapidly
- Overwhelming opponent

**Tactical Impact:**
- Opponent must retreat
- Continuous pressure
- No time to think
- Forced into corners/obstacles
- Eventually makes mistake

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: First Combination**
- Opening through first downright-thrust
- Steps 1-7 only
- Master this sequence
- Partner pressure-tests

**Week 2: Second Combination**
- Add rabett-downright-thrust
- Steps 8-10 added
- Focus on lithely rabett
- Continuous from first combination

**Week 3: Full Integration**
- Complete Eighth Counter
- Opening → double combination → safety
- No pauses
- Flowing execution
- Partner must defend throughout

**Week 4: Distance Management**
- Start at edge of range
- Execute full Counter
- Should reach opponent by step 6-7
- Cover distance efficiently
- Don't overextend

**Week 5: Speed and Power**
- Increase execution speed
- Maintain power on downrights
- Quick (lithely) transitions
- Test stamina (13 steps is tiring)

**Week 6+: Realistic Pressure**
- Partner resists fully
- Partner counter-attacks when able
- You must maintain pressure
- Develop combat-ready execution
- Build conditioning

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Rushing through—13 steps require control
- Weak first combination—must genuinely threaten
- Pausing before second combination—should flow
- Not advancing far enough—four forward steps required
- Rabett not "lithely"—should be quick
- Weak second downright—must match first's power
- Insufficient safety sequence—two actions needed
- Gassing out—this Counter is exhausting

#### STAMINA AND CONDITIONING

**Physical Demands:**

**Cardiovascular:**
- 13 continuous actions
- 4 forward steps
- 2 power cuts (downright)
- High intensity throughout

**Muscular:**
- Two-handed power strikes
- Multiple footwork transitions
- Core stability throughout
- Arm endurance for thrusts

**Training:**
This Counter is excellent conditioning drill:
- Execute 5 times in row
- 30-second rest between
- Builds fight endurance
- Prepares for sustained engagements

**Combat Reality:**
Real fights are exhausting. The Eighth Counter teaches:
- Maintain technique when tired
- Push through fatigue
- Pressure opponent despite exhaustion
- Condition = tactical advantage

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**

**Against Defensive Opponents:**
- Won't attack your proffers
- Wait for your mistakes
- Rely on counter-attacks
- Need to be overwhelmed

**Your Strategy:**
- Proffer draws attention
- First combination tests defense
- Second combination breaks defense
- Sustained pressure forces error

**When NOT to Use:**
- When tired yourself
- Against counter-fighters who want you to commit
- Late in bout (stamina concerns)
- Against much larger opponents (they won't be pushed back easily)

#### COMBINATION THEORY

**Why Downright → Thrust Works:**

**Biomechanics:**
- Downright descends vertically
- Natural recovery raises hands
- Hands high = belly/center exposed
- Thrust targets exposed center

**Timing:**
- Downright forces defensive reaction
- Reaction takes time
- Thrust arrives during reaction
- No time to adjust defense

**Psychology:**
- Heavy cut creates fear
- Fear creates hesitation
- Thrust exploits hesitation
- Compound stress

**Repeatability:**
Works first time, works second time because:
- Same biomechanics
- Same timing advantage
- Increased fear (happened before)
- Opponent knows it's coming but still can't defend

#### PARTNER DRILL: "THE PRESSURE COOKER"

**Setup:**
- Partner defends passively
- You execute Eighth Counter
- Partner tries to survive without counter-attacking

**Pressure Points:**
- After first downright: Can partner recover guard?
- After first thrust: Is partner balanced?
- After rabett: Does partner's blade move?
- After second downright: Can partner maintain defense?
- After second thrust: Is partner still in fight?

**Success:**
Partner says: "I couldn't defend all of that"

**Failure:**
Partner says: "I had openings to counter throughout"

**Adjustment:**
If partner can defend:
- Increase speed
- Increase power
- Tighten spacing
- Eliminate pauses

#### HISTORICAL CONTEXT: SUSTAINED COMBINATIONS

**Medieval Combat:**

Real fights weren't single exchanges:
- Multiple blows common
- Sustained pressure necessary
- Breaks only when someone retreats/falls
- Stamina = survival

**The Eighth Counter:**
Trains for sustained combat:
- Long combinations
- Continuous movement
- Maintained technique under fatigue
- Realistic preparation

**Modern Application:**
Tournament bouts last 2-3 minutes:
- Multiple exchanges inevitable
- Must execute when tired
- This Counter builds requisite stamina
- Tactical and physical training combined

#### COMPARATIVE COMPLEXITY

**Counter Complexity Ranking:**

1. **Eighth Counter:** 13+ steps (most complex)
2. Twenty-Second Counter: 11+ steps
3. Seventh Counter: 10+ steps
4. Most others: 6-9 steps
5. First Counter: 7 steps (baseline)

**Why Vary Complexity:**
- Simple Counters: Learn fundamentals
- Medium Counters: Build combinations
- Complex Counters: Test mastery
- Progressive difficulty = progressive learning

**Pedagogical Progression:**
Start simple, add complexity gradually, culminate in sophisticated sequences like Eighth Counter.

### CHAPTER 27: THE NINTH COUNTER - "THE DOUBLE ROUND WITH 2 THRUSTS"

**Original Text:** *The ixth callyde ye Doble rounde wt ij Foynes A double rounde forwarde wt a foyne at hys face An other att hys bely Standyng ſtyll pley a quarter full wt an other voyde be att yor ſtope.*

**Modern English:** A Double Round forward, with a thrust at his face, another at his belly. Standing still play a Quarter full, with another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Ninth Counter breaks pattern by omitting the standard proffer-rake opening. It begins with movement (double round), making it reactive to opponent's position or initiative rather than proactive baiting."[3]

> "The high-low thrust combination (face then belly) is tactical genius—after face thrust, opponent guards high, exposing belly. Sequential targeting of opposite lines creates unavoidable threat."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **NO proffer-rake opening** (unique)
- Begins with double round (movement-based)
- Two thrusts to different targets
- High-low combination again
- Simpler than recent Counters
- Standing still for final actions

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Double round creates angles/momentum
- Face thrust draws high guard
- Belly thrust exploits high guard
- Simple but highly effective
- Speed over complexity

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Double Round | Forward movement | Two circular motions advancing |
| 2 | Thrust to face | Stand or extend | High-line thrust |
| 3 | Thrust to belly | Stand | Low-line thrust |
| 4 | (Position) | Stand still | Explicitly stable |
| 5 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### NO PROFFER-RAKE OPENING

**Why Skip Standard Opening:**

**Different Tactical Context:**
- Other Counters: You draw opponent's attack
- This Counter: You respond to existing situation
- No need to bait—situation already presents

**When to Use This Counter:**
- Opponent already attacking
- You're both in motion
- No time for proffer setup
- Immediate response required

**Reactive vs. Proactive:**
- Most Counters: Proactive (you create situation)
- Ninth Counter: Reactive (situation already exists)
- Different applications
- Both necessary

#### DOUBLE ROUND MECHANICS

**What Is Double Round:**

Covered in previous Chases, but applied differently here:

**As Opening Movement:**
1. First circular motion (360°)
2. Second circular motion (360°)
3. Both while advancing forward
4. Creates momentum for thrusts

**Functions:**

**Distance Closure:**
- Covers ground while circling
- Approaches opponent
- Establishes range for thrusts

**Angle Creation:**
- Circular motion changes approach angle
- Opponent can't predict exact line
- Creates uncertainty

**Momentum:**
- Rotational energy
- Transfers into thrust
- More powerful than static thrust

**Intimidation:**
- Dynamic, aggressive movement
- Opponent sees commitment
- Psychological pressure

#### HIGH-LOW THRUST SEQUENCE

**Face → Belly Combination:**

**Biomechanical Reality:**

**Face Thrust:**
- Opponent guards high to protect face
- Hands raised
- Belly/center exposed
- Natural defensive response

**Belly Thrust:**
- Exploits raised hands
- Targets now-exposed center
- Opponent can't lower guard fast enough
- Opening exists during transition

**Timing Is Everything:**
- Face thrust must genuinely threaten
- Opponent MUST react (guard high)
- Belly thrust immediate (no pause)
- Window of opportunity is brief

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Double Round Forward**
- Practice circular movements
- While advancing forward
- Maintain balance
- Control momentum
- Build consistency

**Week 2: Double Round → Face Thrust**
- Complete rounds
- Immediate thrust to face
- Use rotational momentum
- Transition must be smooth
- No pause between

**Week 3: Add Belly Thrust**
- After face thrust
- Immediate belly thrust
- Visualize opponent guarding high
- Target exposed center
- Quick execution

**Week 4: Add Standing Sequence**
- Stand still explicitly
- Quarter full
- Void
- Stop guard
- Complete Ninth Counter

**Week 5+: Partner Testing**
- Partner observes double round
- Face thrust: Do they guard high?
- Belly thrust: Does it find opening?
- If not, adjust timing/targeting
- Build instinctive execution

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Weak double round that doesn't create momentum
- Horizontal thrusts instead of high-low angles
- Pausing between face and belly thrusts
- Belly thrust too high (not actually targeting belly)
- Moving during "standing still" sequence
- Weak quarter—should be "full" (committed)
- Insufficient void—must create real distance

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**In-Fight Response:**

**Scenario:**
- You and opponent circling
- Both looking for opening
- Neither wants to commit first
- Stalemate

**Your Response:**
- Execute double round (you commit)
- Face thrust breaks stalemate
- Belly thrust capitalizes
- Back to guard quickly

**Advantage:**
- Breaks stalemate on your terms
- Double attack overwhelms
- Quick return to guard = safety
- Opponent still reacting while you're ready

#### HIGH-LOW TARGET THEORY

**Universal Principle:**

**Human Defense:**
- Naturally protects face/head
- Belly/center secondary priority
- Can't defend both simultaneously at distance

**Sequential Targeting:**
- Force high defense (face threat)
- Exploit low opening (belly thrust)
- Works because of biological priorities

**Other Applications:**
- Boxing: Jab (high) → Body shot (low)
- Kicking: High kick → Sweep (low)
- Wrestling: Headlock → Leg takedown

**Why This Works:**
Humans have limited bandwidth—forcing defense of primary target creates openings in secondary targets.

#### STANDING STILL EMPHASIS

**After Thrusts:**

Text explicitly says "standing still" before quarter.

**Why:**

**Stability:**
- Two thrusts create momentum
- Must stabilize before quarter
- Standing still = regaining control

**Tempo:**
- Thrusts were quick (lithely)
- Quarter should be different rhythm
- Standing still creates tempo change
- Opponent adjusts to speed, gets power

**Safety:**
- Two forward thrusts = extended position
- Standing still = recovery
- Quarter from stable platform = control
- Void from balance = effective

#### PARTNER DRILL: "HIGH-LOW REACTION"

**Setup:**
- You execute face thrust
- Partner must defend
- Observe: How do they defend?

**Test:**
- Do hands go high?
- Does body lean back?
- Does head move?
- Any of these = belly now open

**Exploitation:**
- Immediate belly thrust
- Target the created opening
- Partner should be unable to defend both

**Success Criteria:**
- Partner must choose: Face or belly?
- If they defend face, belly succeeds
- If they defend belly, face succeeds
- They can't defend both = technique works

#### SIMPLICITY AFTER COMPLEXITY

**Pedagogical Design:**

**Eighth Counter:** 13 steps, highly complex
**Ninth Counter:** 7 steps, relatively simple

**Why:**
- Give student break from complexity
- Reinforce that simple can be effective
- Build confidence
- Prepare for more complexity to come

**Lesson:**
Complexity isn't always better. Simple, well-executed techniques defeat complex, poorly-executed ones.

George Silver: "The simple fight is the true fight."[7]

### CHAPTER 23: THE FIFTH COUNTER - "THE 3 QUARTERS"

**Original Text:** *The Vth callyd the iij quarters A pfur a rake wyth a quarter full ſtanding ſtylle pley an other voyde a bove hys hede wt an other at hys legge then voyde bake the ryght legge wt an other quarter and be att youre ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter full. Standing still play another void above his head, with another at his leg. Then void back the right leg with another Quarter and be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Fifth Counter is nearly identical to the First Counter—both use the high-low combination and retreat pattern. This repetition isn't error; it's pedagogical emphasis. The manuscript reinforces that this fundamental pattern works."[3]

> "Notice 'standing still' is emphasized—while executing the high void and leg attack, you remain stationary. This creates a stable platform for accurate targeting and allows explosive movement if needed."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Nearly identical to First Counter**
- Also called "The 3 Quarters"
- Reinforces fundamental pattern
- Standing still emphasized
- High-low combination again
- Standard safety retreat

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Prove the pattern's reliability (worth repeating)
- Slight variation develops adaptability
- Different tactical contexts for same technique
- Builds confidence through familiarity

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter (full) | Stand still | Committed cut |
| 4 | Void above head | **Stand still** | High defensive evasion |
| 5 | Attack to leg | **Stand still** | Low-line strike |
| 6 | Quarter | Void back right leg | Cut while retreating |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### STANDING STILL EMPHASIS

**Why "Standing Still" Matters:**

**Tactical Advantages:**

**Stability:**
- Solid base for techniques
- Better accuracy
- More power in strikes
- Balance maintained

**Deception:**
- Opponent expects movement
- Static position surprises
- Creates hesitation
- Opens opportunities

**Energy Conservation:**
- No wasted movement
- Efficient technique
- Stamina preserved
- Can sustain longer

**Ready to Explode:**
- Coiled position
- Can burst any direction
- Opponent can't predict
- Maximum tactical flexibility

#### REPETITION IN MEDIEVAL PEDAGOGY

**Why Repeat the Same Counter?**

Modern students might question: "Why have both First and Fifth Counters if they're nearly identical?"

**Medieval Teaching Method:**

**Principle Over Technique:**
- Not learning exact sequence
- Learning underlying principle
- Repetition internalizes concept
- Variation prevents rote memorization

**Spacing in Curriculum:**
- First Counter (early): Introduction
- Fifth Counter (middle): Reinforcement
- Sixteenth Counter (later): Mastery check

**Different Contexts:**
- Same technique
- Different tactical situations
- Teaches adaptability
- "This works in many scenarios"

**Confidence Building:**
- "I've done this before"
- Success breeds success
- Familiar = reliable
- Reduces hesitation in combat

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Recognition**
- Compare First and Fifth Counters
- Identify differences (if any)
- Note: They're essentially identical
- Understand pedagogical purpose

**Week 2: Perfection Through Repetition**
- Already know this pattern
- Focus on perfecting details
- Improve accuracy
- Increase speed

**Week 3: Standing Still Focus**
- Execute high-low combo without foot movement
- Develop stability
- Test balance throughout
- Ensure accuracy from static position

**Week 4: Tactical Variation**
- Use in different situations
- Against different opponent types
- Vary proffer types
- Adapt timing

**Week 5+: Internalization**
- Should be automatic now
- No thought required
- Muscle memory complete
- Focus shifts to tactics, not technique

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Thinking this is "wrong" or redundant—it's intentional
- Moving feet during high-low combo—should stay still
- Rushing because "I already know this"—perfect it
- Not taking it seriously—fundamental pattern deserves respect
- Missing subtle differences if any exist
- Forgetting the lesson: reliable techniques are repeated

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When Fifth Differs from First:**

Though nearly identical, context determines which you're "doing":

**First Counter:**
- Used early in bout
- Establishing pattern
- Testing opponent
- Building strategy

**Fifth Counter:**
- Used mid-bout
- Reinforcing pattern
- Confirming pattern works
- Demonstrating consistency

**Psychological Dimension:**
- "You can't adapt to this"
- "It works every time"
- "Your defense is insufficient"
- Creates frustration

#### THE THREE "3 QUARTERS" COUNTERS

**First Counter:** Foundation  
**Fifth Counter:** Reinforcement  
**Sixteenth Counter:** (Upcoming) Final confirmation

**Together They Teach:**
- This pattern is fundamental
- Master it completely
- Use it confidently
- Adapt it tactically

**Modern Equivalent:**
Like teaching jab-cross-hook in boxing:
- Teach it early
- Drill it repeatedly
- Return to it often
- It never stops being effective

#### STANDING STILL DRILL

**Solo Practice:**
1. Assume combat stance
2. Execute void above head (no foot movement)
3. Execute leg attack (no foot movement)
4. Hold balance for 5 seconds
5. Repeat 20 times

**Success Criteria:**
- Perfect balance throughout
- No foot shuffling
- No wobbling
- Accurate targeting
- Feels natural and stable

**Partner Drill:**
- Partner observes your feet
- Execute high-low combo
- Partner calls out if feet move
- Goal: Zero foot movement

### CHAPTER 24: THE SIXTH POINT - "THE CROSS RAKE"

**Original Text:** *The Vjth Poynte callyde the cros Rake A pfur a cros rake wt a foyne at hys face wt a quarter full and an other A voyde be at youre ſtoppe*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Cross-Rake, with a thrust at his face with a Quarter full and another, a void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Cross-Rake is a diagonal cutting motion—'cross' meaning crossing or diagonal. Unlike straight rakes to hands, the cross-rake comes from an angle, making it harder to defend and creating different openings."[3]

> "This Counter is notably simpler than previous ones—only six actions instead of eight or nine. Sometimes simplicity is most effective, especially when the signature technique (cross-rake) is sufficiently powerful."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Simpler Counter** (fewer steps)
- "Cross-Rake" = diagonal/crossing motion
- Direct thrust to face after rake
- No complex footwork
- Standard safety finish
- Efficiency emphasized

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Diagonal rake from unexpected angle
- Face thrust immediately exploits opening
- Simple execution = fast execution
- Fewer steps = fewer things to go wrong

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | **Cross-Rake** | Stand | Diagonal cutting motion |
| 3 | Thrust to face | Stand or extend | Immediate follow-up |
| 4 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 5 | Another action | Stand or void | Likely another quarter |
| 6 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 7 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE CROSS-RAKE TECHNIQUE

**What "Cross" Means:**

**Interpretation 1: Diagonal Angle**
- Cut at 45° angle
- Crosses opponent's center line
- Like X-pattern slash
- "Cross" = crossing motion

**Interpretation 2: Crossing Rakes**
- Two rakes that cross paths
- First right-to-left
- Second left-to-right
- Forms X pattern

**Most Likely: Diagonal Single Rake**
- One powerful diagonal cut
- Crosses from side to opposite side
- Harder to defend than vertical/horizontal
- Creates specific opening for face thrust

**Execution:**

**Right-Side Cross-Rake:**
1. Start high right
2. Cut diagonally downward left
3. Target opponent's hands/forearms
4. Blade crosses their center line

**Left-Side Cross-Rake:**
1. Start high left
2. Cut diagonally downward right
3. Same target areas
4. Mirror of right-side version

#### DIAGONAL MECHANICS

**Why Diagonal Works:**

**Guard Geometry:**
- Most guards protect vertical
- Most guards protect horizontal
- Diagonal angle is "between" defenses
- Harder to intercept

**Force Application:**
- Diagonal uses body rotation
- Hip torque adds power
- More force than pure arm cut
- Natural body mechanics

**Opening Creation:**
- Diagonal rake displaces guard high-left or high-right
- Face becomes exposed on opposite side
- Thrust enters the opening
- Clean target presentation

#### SIMPLICITY AS STRENGTH

**Shorter Sequence = Faster Execution:**

**Compare:**
- Fourth Counter: 9 steps
- Sixth Counter: 7 steps
- Time saved: ~2-3 seconds

**In Combat:**
- 2-3 seconds is huge
- Opponent has less time to counter
- You return to guard faster
- Can execute more times per bout

**Modern Principle:**
Military maxim: "Simple plans executed quickly beat complex plans executed slowly."

The Sixth Counter embodies this—simple, fast, effective.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Diagonal Rake Mechanics**
- Practice diagonal cuts (no opponent)
- High right → low left
- High left → low right
- Feel hip rotation
- Build power through angle

**Week 2: Target Accuracy**
- Partner presents hands/forearms
- Execute cross-rake
- Must hit target zone
- Diagonal angle maintained
- Partner rates accuracy

**Week 3: Rake-Thrust Combination**
- Cross-rake creates opening
- Immediate thrust to face
- No pause between
- Smooth transition
- Partner observes opening creation

**Week 4: Full Counter**
- Add proffer opening
- Complete sequence
- Add safety finish
- Focus on speed
- Time yourself

**Week 5+: Pressure Testing**
- Partner actively defends
- You execute Sixth Counter
- Does cross-rake beat their defense?
- Does thrust reach face?
- Adjust as needed

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Vertical rake instead of diagonal—defeats "cross" purpose
- Weak rake that doesn't displace—must threaten
- Pausing between rake and thrust—should be immediate
- Thrust off-target—face is specific target
- Overcomplicating simple technique
- Not committing to "full" quarter
- Forgetting safety void

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent defends well against vertical attacks
- Need fast, simple counter
- Stamina is low (fewer movements)
- Opponent expects complex technique
- Want to establish basic effectiveness

**Against Different Guards:**

**High Guards:**
- Cross-rake comes underneath
- Displaces downward
- Face exposed high

**Center Guards:**
- Cross-rake comes from side
- Displaces laterally
- Face exposed opposite side

**Low Guards:**
- Cross-rake comes overhead
- Displaces upward
- Face exposed from angle

**Adaptability:**
Cross-rake works against multiple guard types—versatile technique.

#### THE "ANOTHER" AMBIGUITY

**Text says:** "with a quarter full and another"

**Possible Interpretations:**

**Another Quarter:**
- Two quarters total
- Double the safety
- Common pattern

**Another Action:**
- Could be void
- Could be thrust
- Could be rake
- Practitioner choice

**Modern Approach:**
- Most interpret as another quarter
- Double quarter = double safety
- Consistent with other Counters
- Makes tactical sense

#### CROSS-RAKE VARIATIONS

**Direction Options:**

**Right Cross-Rake:**
- Right shoulder to left hip line
- Targets left side of opponent
- Natural for right-handed fencers

**Left Cross-Rake:**
- Left shoulder to right hip line
- Targets right side of opponent
- Develops ambidextrous capability

**Training:**
Practice both directions equally:
- Builds bilateral skill
- Prevents predictability
- Allows adaptation to opponent position

#### EFFICIENCY PRINCIPLE

**The Sixth Counter Teaches:**

**Don't Overcomplicate:**
- Simple technique executed well
- Beats complex technique executed poorly
- Efficiency wins fights

**Speed Matters:**
- Fast simple > slow complex
- Return to guard quickly
- Ready for next action sooner

**Energy Conservation:**
- Fewer movements = less energy
- Can execute more times
- Stamina lasts longer

**George Silver Later Wrote:**
> "The shortest fight is the best fight. He who uses unnecessary actions gives his enemy opportunity."[7]

The Sixth Counter embodies this wisdom—minimal actions, maximum effect.

#### PARTNER DRILL: "CROSS-RAKE EFFECTIVENESS"

**Setup:**
- Partner holds guard (their choice)
- You execute cross-rake
- Does it displace their guard?
- Is face exposed?

**Scoring:**
- Face clearly exposed: 3 points
- Face partially exposed: 1 point
- Face still protected: 0 points

**Iterate:**
- Try different rake angles
- Adjust force
- Find optimal execution
- Document what works

### CHAPTER 25: THE SEVENTH POINT - "THE DOWN-RIGHT STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The Vijth poynte callyd ye Downeryght ſtroke A pfur A rake wyth a quarter an other a voyde a Downeryght Stroke folowyde wyth the ryght legge then ſtandyng ſtyll lythly play a fore foyne wt a quarter and an other voyde be att youre stope*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter, another, a void. A Down-right stroke followed with the right leg, then standing still lithely play a For-thrust, with a Quarter, and another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Seventh Counter combines power (downright stroke) with speed (lithely played fore-thrust). The standing still position between downright and thrust creates a momentary pause that can deceive the opponent about your next action."[3]

> "Notice the pattern: void creates distance → downright closes while attacking → standing still resets → quick thrust exploits → safety sequence exits. This is distance manipulation at its finest."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Downright stroke** is signature technique
- Followed with right leg = advance while cutting
- **"Lithely play"** = quick, light fore-thrust
- Standing still creates tactical pause
- Mix of power (downright) and speed (fore-thrust)
- Longer sequence (10 steps)

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Initial void creates space
- Downright reclaims space with power
- Standing still creates uncertainty
- Quick thrust capitalizes on confusion
- Safety sequence ensures retreat

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | First quarter |
| 4 | Another action | Stand | Likely another quarter |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 6 | **Downright stroke** | Follow with right leg | Power cut + advance |
| 7 | (Pause) | **Stand still** | Tactical stillness |
| 8 | **Fore-thrust** | Stand | **Lithely** = quick thrust |
| 9 | Quarter | Stand | Safety cut |
| 10 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 11 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### DOWNRIGHT STROKE WITH FOLLOW

**Simultaneous Action:**

"Followed with the right leg" means:
- Downright stroke and right step happen together
- Not sequential (cut then step)
- Coordinated action
- Maximizes power and range

**Mechanics:**

**Initiation:**
1. Weight on left leg
2. Right leg ready
3. Sword raised for downright

**Execution:**
1. Begin downright cut
2. Simultaneously step right forward
3. Weight transfers onto right leg
4. Sword descends with body weight
5. Maximum force at impact

**Benefits:**
- Greater reach (step extends)
- More power (body weight)
- Faster closing (advance while cutting)
- Harder to evade (covers ground)

#### THE TACTICAL PAUSE

**"Standing Still" After Downright:**

**Why Pause?**

**Deception:**
- Opponent expects continuous attack
- Pause disrupts their timing
- They prepare for next attack
- Wrong attack comes (thrust not cut)

**Assessment:**
- Brief moment to observe
- Did downright work?
- Is opponent committed?
- Where are openings?

**Loading:**
- Pause is coiled position
- Ready to explode
- Spring-like tension
- Thrust releases energy

**Contrast:**
- Downright = powerful, committed
- Pause = still, controlled
- Fore-thrust = quick, surprising
- Opponent can't track the rhythm

#### "LITHELY PLAY A FORE-THRUST"

**Breaking Down the Phrase:**

**"Lithely":**
- Quickly
- Lightly (not heavily telegraphed)
- Agile
- Graceful

**"Play":**
- Execute
- Perform
- Deliver
- (Not literal "play" = practice)

**"Fore-thrust":**
- Straight forward thrust
- To front target
- Direct attack

**Combined Meaning:**
"Execute a quick, light, forward thrust"

**Execution:**
- No windup
- Minimal telegraphing
- Explosive from stillness
- Catches opponent off-guard

#### POWER-SPEED COMBINATION

**Strategic Principle:**

**Power (Downright):**
- Forces opponent to commit defense
- They raise guard
- Brace for impact
- Tense muscles

**Speed (Fore-thrust):**
- Comes while they're still processing power attack
- They're tensed for cut
- Thrust is different threat
- Can't adjust fast enough

**This Combination:**
Appears throughout martial arts:
- Boxing: Heavy hook → quick jab
- Kendo: Big strike → small strike
- Fencing: Beat attack → quick thrust

**Principle:**
Different techniques require different defenses. Mix them to overwhelm opponent's decision-making.

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Downright + Follow**
- Practice downright stroke
- Add right leg step simultaneously
- Coordination drill (20 reps)
- Feel power from combined action

**Week 2: Standing Still Pause**
- After downright, freeze
- Hold for 1-2 seconds
- Maintain balance
- Feel tension/readiness

**Week 3: Quick Fore-Thrust**
- From standing still
- Explosive thrust
- "Lithely" = no telegraphing
- Partner can't anticipate

**Week 4: Power-Speed Flow**
- Downright (power) → pause → thrust (speed)
- Smooth sequence
- Distinct techniques
- Partner feels difference

**Week 5: Full Integration**
- Add opening (proffer-rake-quarters-void)
- Main sequence (downright-pause-thrust)
- Safety (quarter-void-stop)
- Complete Seventh Counter

**Week 6+: Tactical Application**
- Use in sparring
- Test if pause creates confusion
- Verify thrust catches opponent
- Refine based on results

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Sequential instead of simultaneous (downright then step vs. together)
- No actual pause—rushing through
- Pause too long—becomes telegraphing
- Heavy fore-thrust instead of "lithely"
- Weak downright that doesn't force defense
- Not following with right leg far enough
- Forgetting dual void (one before downright, one at end)

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent defends against continuous attacks well
- Need to disrupt their timing
- Want to test their adaptability
- Mix power and speed to confuse
- After establishing rhythm (pause breaks it)

**Against Rhythm-Based Fighters:**
Some opponents:
- Find your rhythm
- Time their counters
- Predict your pattern
- Execute based on timing

**Against Them:**
- Establish rhythm (proffer-rake-quarters)
- Break rhythm (pause after downright)
- Their timing fails
- Thrust lands during confusion

#### VOID-ATTACK-VOID PATTERN

**Distance Oscillation:**

**First Void (Step 5):**
- Creates distance
- Appears defensive
- Opponent may pursue

**Downright + Advance (Step 6):**
- Reclaims distance
- Turns defense to offense
- Surprises pursuing opponent

**Second Void (Step 10):**
- Creates distance again
- After committed attacks
- Safety priority

**This Pattern:**
- You control distance
- Opponent always adjusting
- Never settles into comfortable range
- Constant uncertainty

#### FORE-THRUST TARGETING

**"At His Face" Implied:**

Though text doesn't specify, fore-thrust likely targets face:
- Consistent with other Counters
- High-priority target
- Standing still position = good height for face thrust
- After downright (likely aimed lower), face may be exposed

**Alternative Targets:**
- Throat (below face)
- Chest (center mass)
- Shoulder (if downright lowered guard)

**Training:**
Practice fore-thrust to all targets, adapt based on what downright exposed.

#### PARTNER DRILL: "RHYTHM DISRUPTION"

**Setup:**
- Partner attacks with rhythm (1-2-3-4 pattern)
- You execute Seventh Counter
- Focus on pause breaking their rhythm

**Success Criteria:**
- Partner should be confused by pause
- Thrust should catch them unprepared
- They shouldn't counter thrust successfully

**If They Counter:**
- Pause wasn't effective (too short or too long)
- Thrust wasn't quick enough
- Adjust timing and speed

### CHAPTER 26: THE EIGHTH COUNTER - "THE RABETT WITH A DOWN-RIGHT STROKE"

**Original Text:** *The viijth callyde the rabett wt a Downe ryght Stroke A pfur a rake wt a quarter A nother A voyde a Downe ryght stroke folowyde wt the ryght legge wt a fore foyne ſettyng In the lyffte legge lyththly pley a rabett then ſett In ye ryght legge wt a Downryght Stroke a foyne wt a quarter an other a voyde be att yor ſtoppe.*

**Modern English:** A Proffer, a Rake, with a Quarter, another, a void. A Down-right stroke followed with the right leg, with a For-thrust. Setting in the left leg lithely play a Rabett, then set in the right leg with a Down-right stroke, a thrust, with a Quarter, another, a void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Eighth Counter is the most complex Counter in the manuscript—thirteen distinct actions including two downright strokes, two thrusts, and a rabett. This teaches advanced practitioners how to maintain offensive pressure through extended sequences."[3]

> "Notice the aggressive footwork pattern: void back, then three steps forward (right-left-right). This is overwhelming advance that collapses distance rapidly and forces opponent into retreat or desperate defense."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **Most complex Counter** (13 steps)
- **Two Downright strokes** at different points
- Aggressive three-step forward pattern
- **Rabett in the middle** controls the exchange
- "Lithely" appears again (quick execution)
- Extended offensive pressure
- Standard safety finish

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Sustained assault overwhelms opponent
- Multiple power strikes (two downrights)
- Rabett maintains control
- Continuous forward pressure
- No opportunity for counter
- Safety ensured at end

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Proffer | Stand | Draw attack |
| **OPPONENT** | Attacks | Advances | Takes bait |
| 2 | Rake | Stand | Disrupt attack |
| 3 | Quarter | Stand | First quarter |
| 4 | Another action | Stand | Likely another quarter |
| 5 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 6 | **First Downright** | Follow with right leg | Advance + power cut |
| 7 | Fore-thrust | Stand | Quick thrust |
| 8 | **Rabett** | Set in left leg (lithely) | Advance + control blade |
| 9 | **Second Downright** | Set in right leg | Advance + power cut |
| 10 | Thrust (foyne) | Stand | Follow-up thrust |
| 11 | Quarter | Stand | Safety cut |
| 12 | Another action | Stand | Likely another quarter/void |
| 13 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 14 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### THE TRIPLE ADVANCE PATTERN

**Three-Step Forward Sequence:**

**Step 1 (Right + First Downright):**
- Close distance
- Power strike
- Establishes pressure
- Forces defensive response

**Step 2 (Left + Rabett):**
- Continue advance
- Control opponent's blade
- Maintain pressure
- Set up final assault

**Step 3 (Right + Second Downright):**
- Maximum advance
- Second power strike
- Overwhelming force
- Decisive commitment

**Total Distance:**
Three steps cover approximately 6-9 feet—massive closing of distance.

#### WHY TWO DOWNRIGHT STROKES?

**Strategic Rationale:**

**First Downright:**
- Tests opponent's defense
- Forces them to commit
- Creates initial opening
- Sets up sequence

**Rabett Between:**
- Capitalizes on their defensive commitment
- Controls their blade position
- Maintains your initiative
- Prevents recovery

**Second Downright:**
- Exploits opening rabett created
- Opponent still processing first downright
- Overwhelming power on overwhelmed defense
- Finishes the assault

**Principle:**
One power attack = defendable  
Two power attacks with control between = overwhelming

#### COMPLEXITY MANAGEMENT

**How to Master 13+ Steps:**

**Phase Training:**

**Phase 1 (Steps 1-5): Setup**
- Proffer-rake-quarters-void
- Standard opening
- Should be automatic from previous Counters

**Phase 2 (Steps 6-7): First Assault**
- Downright + right step
- Fore-thrust
- Practice until smooth

**Phase 3 (Steps 8-10): Control and Power**
- Rabett + left step
- Downright + right step
- Thrust
- Most complex phase

**Phase 4 (Steps 11-14): Safety**
- Quarter-action-void-stop
- Standard ending
- Should be automatic

**Integration:**
- Week 1: Phase 1
- Week 2: Phase 2
- Week 3: Phase 3
- Week 4: Phase 4
- Week 5: Combine phases
- Week 6+: Full sequence

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Opening Sequence**
- Proffer through first void
- Should be automatic from other Counters
- Focus: Smooth execution

**Week 2: First Assault**
- First downright + right step
- Add fore-thrust
- Practice 30 times
- Build muscle memory

**Week 3: Rabett Integration**
- After fore-thrust
- Quick set-in left (lithely)
- Rabett execution
- Feel blade control

**Week 4: Second Assault**
- After rabett
- Set in right
- Second downright
- Add thrust
- Complete offensive sequence

**Week 5: Add Safety**
- Quarter-action-void-stop
- Complete Eighth Counter
- Run full sequence 10 times
- Slow initially

**Week 6: Speed Building**
- Increase execution speed
- Maintain form
- No steps skipped
- Time yourself

**Week 7+: Partner Pressure**
- Partner actively resists
- They try to counter
- You must maintain sequence
- Test under pressure

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Losing track of which downright you're on
- Rushing through—speed comes after mastery
- Weak rabett between downrights—critical for control
- Not advancing far enough (three steps should cover ground)
- Pausing to remember next step—breaks flow
- Weak thrusts—both must threaten
- Forgetting "lithely" on rabett set-in
- Not committing to full sequence—half measures fail
- Poor stamina management—this is exhausting

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent relies on single defense
- You have significant stamina advantage
- Need to overwhelm cautious fighter
- Want to demonstrate dominance
- Late in bout when opponent tiring

**Against Defensive Masters:**
Some opponents:
- Defend everything
- Never take risks
- Wait for your mistakes
- Frustrate aggressive fencers

**Against Them:**
- Eighth Counter is relentless
- No pause for them to counter
- Sustained pressure breaks perfect defense
- Eventually makes mistake
- Your sequence capitalizes

**Risk:**
- Very committing
- If fails, you're extended
- Stamina intensive
- Should be decisive

**Reward:**
- Usually ends exchange
- Demonstrates superiority
- Breaks opponent's will
- Can end bout

#### THE RABETT'S CRITICAL ROLE

**Positioned Between Downrights:**

**Why Here?**

**After First Downright:**
- Opponent's blade has moved (from defense)
- Blade position somewhat predictable
- Perfect time to control with rabett

**Before Second Downright:**
- Rabett sets blade position
- Creates specific opening
- Second downright exploits that opening
- Maximum effectiveness

**Execution:**
- Rabett must genuinely displace
- If weak, second downright has no opening
- If strong, second downright unstoppable

**Training Focus:**
The rabett in step 8 is the **most critical single action** in this Counter. Perfect it.

#### STAMINA CONSIDERATIONS

**The Eighth Counter is Exhausting:**

**Energy Expenditure:**
- Two power cuts (downrights)
- Three advancing steps
- One rabett
- Two thrusts
- Multiple quarters
- = Significant cardiovascular demand

**Conditioning:**
To execute effectively:
- Build cardio endurance
- Practice full sequence repeatedly
- Don't attempt if fatigued
- Reserve for decisive moments

**Tactical Timing:**
- Use early in bout (when fresh) OR
- Use against tired opponent (they can't defend) OR
- Save for decisive moment (finish them)

**Don't Use:**
- When you're tired
- Against fresh opponent
- Repeatedly in same bout
- Without confidence in completion

#### SEQUENTIAL PRESSURE THEORY

**The Principle:**

**Each Action:**
- Builds on previous
- Maintains pressure
- Prevents recovery
- Advances initiative

**If Opponent:**
- Defends action 1 → action 2 attacks
- Defends action 2 → action 3 attacks
- Defends action 3 → action 4 attacks
- Continue pattern

**Result:**
- Perfect defense required for all actions
- One mistake = opening
- Sustained pressure creates mistakes
- Opening = successful Counter

**Medieval Combat:**
This reflects battlefield reality:
- Single attacks rarely decisive
- Sustained assault wins
- Endurance matters
- Pressure breaks defense

#### PARTNER DRILL: "THE GAUNTLET"

**Setup:**
- You execute Eighth Counter
- Partner defends each action
- Track which action succeeds

**Recording:**
- Action 6 (first downright) succeeded: Mark
- Action 8 (rabett) succeeded: Mark
- Action 9 (second downright) succeeded: Mark
- Etc.

**Analysis:**
- Which actions work most often?
- Which need improvement?
- Pattern reveals opponent's weakness
- Adjust technique accordingly

**Goal:**
At least one action should succeed. If none succeed, either:
- Opponent is exceptional (rare)
- Your execution needs work (common)
- Sequence too predictable (adjust timing)

### CHAPTER 27: THE NINTH COUNTER - "THE DOUBLE ROUND WITH 2 THRUSTS"

**Original Text:** *The ixth callyde ye Doble rounde wt ij Foynes A double rounde forwarde wt a foyne at hys face An other att hys bely Standyng ſtyll pley a quarter full wt an other voyde be att yor ſtope.*

**Modern English:** A Double Round forward, with a thrust at his face, another at his belly. Standing still play a Quarter full, with another void, be at your stop.

#### PRACTITIONER TIPS

> "The Ninth Counter breaks the pattern—no proffer-rake opening! It begins with movement (double round) instead of drawing attack. This teaches that not all Counters must be reactive; some can be initiated proactively."[3]

> "The high-low thrust combination (face then belly) is anatomically logical: opponent defending face naturally exposes belly, and vice versa. The double round creates momentum and angles for both thrusts."[5]

**Key Points:**
- **No proffer-rake opening** (unique!)
- Begins with **Double Round forward**
- **Two thrusts:** face then belly (high-low)
- Standing still after thrusts
- Simpler than previous Counters
- Can be proactive or reactive

**Tactical Purpose:**
- Initiate rather than react
- Circular movement creates angles
- High-low thrusts exploit anatomical defense limits
- Simple execution = reliable results
- Quick return to guard

#### STEP BREAKDOWN

| Step # | Cut/Action | Footwork | Notes |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | First Round | Circular forward | First 360° or partial rotation |
| 2 | Second Round | Circular forward | Second 360° or partial rotation |
| 3 | **Thrust to face** | Stand or extend | High-line attack |
| 4 | **Thrust to belly** | Stand or extend | Low-line attack |
| 5 | (Position) | **Stand still** | Static position |
| 6 | Quarter (full) | Stand | Committed cut |
| 7 | Another action | Stand | Likely void |
| 8 | Void | Step back | Create distance |
| 9 | Stop Guard | Stand | Defensive position |

#### DOUBLE ROUND MECHANICS

**What is "Double Round"?**

**Interpretation 1: Two Full Rotations**
- First round = 360° rotation
- Second round = another 360°
- Total = 720° (two complete circles)
- Creates significant momentum

**Interpretation 2: Two Partial Rotations**
- First round = 180° turn
- Second round = another 180°
- Total = 360° (one complete circle)
- More controlled

**Most Likely: Partial Rotations**
- Complete 720° is disorienting
- 360° total is manageable
- Creates angles without dizziness
- Maintains tactical awareness

**Forward Movement:**
- Rounds move you toward opponent
- Not stationary spinning
- Advancing while rotating
- Closes distance while creating angles

#### HIGH-LOW THRUST COMBINATION

**Anatomical Principle:**

**Face Defense:**
- Hands raised high
- Blade protects upper line
- Belly exposed

**Belly Defense:**
- Hands lowered
- Blade protects lower line
- Face exposed

**Sequential Thrusts:**
1. Thrust to face
2. Opponent raises defense
3. Belly now exposed
4. Thrust to belly
5. Opponent can't lower defense fast enough
6. Opening exists

**Why This Works:**
- Human physiology can't defend both simultaneously
- Transition time between guards creates opening
- Sequential attacks exploit transition time
- Defender always one step behind

#### PROACTIVE VS. REACTIVE

**Breaking the Counter Pattern:**

**Previous Counters:**
- Wait for opponent (proffer)
- Respond to their attack (rake)
- Counter their action
- = Reactive

**Ninth Counter:**
- Initiate with rounds
- Don't wait for opponent
- Create your own opportunity
- = Proactive

**Tactical Flexibility:**
This teaches: Counters aren't always counter-attacks. The term "Counter" means tactical response, which can include initiative.

**When to Use Each:**

**Reactive Counters (1-8):**
- Opponent is aggressive
- They attack readily
- You want to punish attacks

**Proactive Counter (9):**
- Opponent is passive
- They won't attack
- You must create opportunity
- Break stalemate

#### TRAINING PROGRESSION

**Week 1: Circular Footwork**
- Practice double round alone
- Without sword
- Forward movement + rotation
- Find balance
- Avoid dizziness

**Week 2: Add Sword Movement**
- Sword describes circles during rounds
- Coordinate blade and feet
- Smooth circular motion
- Build momentum

**Week 3: Thrust Mechanics**
- From double round
- Thrust to face
- Return to guard position
- Thrust to belly
- Quick succession

**Week 4: High-Low Combination**
- Face thrust forces high defense
- Immediate belly thrust
- No pause between
- Partner observes opening creation

**Week 5: Standing Still Phase**
- After thrusts, stand still
- Quarter execution
- Feel stability after motion
- Control after chaos

**Week 6+: Full Integration**
- Complete Ninth Counter
- Double round → thrusts → quarter → void → stop
- Focus on smooth flow
- Test against partner

#### COMMON MISTAKES

- Over-rotating (too many degrees)
- Getting dizzy from spinning
- Weak thrusts that don't threaten
- Pausing between face and belly thrusts
- Belly thrust too high (not actually belly)
- Not standing still after thrusts (moving when shouldn't)
- Losing balance during or after rounds
- Forgetting this is different from other Counters (no proffer)

#### TACTICAL APPLICATIONS

**When to Use:**
- Opponent won't attack (passive)
- Stalemate situation
- Need to take initiative
- Opponent expects reactive Counter
- Want to surprise with aggression

**Psychological Impact:**
- "I don't need you to attack first"
- "I can initiate when I want"
- "Your passivity doesn't protect you"
- Creates pressure on passive opponents

**Setup Opportunities:**
- After several reactive Counters
- Opponent becomes comfortable waiting
- They expect proffer
- Rounds surprise them
- Thrusts land while they're expecting different pattern

#### MOMENTUM UTILIZATION

**Circular Motion Creates:**

**Angular Momentum:**
- Rounds build rotational energy
- Transfers to forward thrust
- Adds power to strikes
- Physics advantage

**Positional Advantage:**
- Circular movement changes angles
- Thrusts come from unexpected directions
- Harder to defend
- Multiple possible entry points

**Psychological Pressure:**
- Motion suggests aggression
- Opponent must track your movement
- Disorienting effect
- Creates hesitation

#### THE STANDING STILL RESET

**After Thrusts:**

**Why Stand Still?**

**Stability:**
- Just completed circular motion
- Just completed two thrusts
- Need moment to rebalance
- Solid platform for quarter

**Assessment:**
- Did thrusts work?
- Where is opponent?
- What's next?

**Contrast:**
- Rounds = motion
- Thrusts = explosive
- Standing still = control
- Quarter = decisive
- Demonstrates complete control throughout

#### DOUBLE ROUND VARIATIONS

**Training Different Patterns:**

**Clockwise Double Round:**
- Right shoulder leads
- Natural for most fencers
- Standard pattern

**Counter-Clockwise Double Round:**
- Left shoulder leads
- Less natural
- Develops ambidextrous capability

**Alternating Rounds:**
- First round clockwise
- Second round counter-clockwise
- More complex
- Greater disorientation (opponent and possibly you!)

**Distance Variations:**
- Small rounds (tight circles)
- Large rounds (wide arcs)
- Adjust based on space available

#### PARTNER DRILL: "HIGH-LOW EFFECTIVENESS"

**Setup:**
1. Partner holds high guard
2. You thrust to face
3. Partner defends
4. You immediately thrust to belly
5. Did belly thrust succeed?

**Then Reverse:**
1. Partner holds low guard
2. You thrust to belly
3. Partner defends
4. You immediately thrust to face
5. Did face thrust succeed?

**Success Criteria:**
- At least one thrust should succeed
- If both fail, timing is wrong
- If both succeed, partner's defense is weak

**Goal:**
High-low combination should be nearly impossible to defend perfectly. If partner defends both, you're telegraphing.
